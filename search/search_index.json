Next integer is the size of a value (buffer) followed by the value itself (of the size). readSnapshotFile creates an UnsafeRow for the value (with the number of fields as indicated by the number of fields of the < >). In the end, readSnapshotFile prints out the following INFO message to the logs and returns the key-value map. Read snapshot file for version [version] of [this] from [fileToRead] In case of FileNotFoundException readSnapshotFile simply returns None (to indicate no snapshot state file was available and so no state for the version). readSnapshotFile throws an IOException for the size of a key or a value below 0 : Error reading snapshot file [fileToRead] of [this]: [key|value] size cannot be [keySize|valueSize] NOTE: readSnapshotFile is used exclusively when HDFSBackedStateStoreProvider is requested to < >. === [[updateFromDeltaFile]] Updating State with State Changes For Specified Version (per Delta File) -- updateFromDeltaFile Internal Method [source, scala] \u00b6 updateFromDeltaFile( version: Long, map: ConcurrentHashMap[UnsafeRow, UnsafeRow]): Unit [NOTE] \u00b6 updateFromDeltaFile is very similar code-wise to < > with the two main differences: updateFromDeltaFile is given the state map to update (while < > loads the state from a snapshot file) updateFromDeltaFile removes a key from the state map when the value (size) is -1 (while < > throws an IOException ) The following description is almost an exact copy of < > just for completeness. \u00b6 updateFromDeltaFile < > for the requested version . updateFromDeltaFile requests the < > to < > and < > ( input ). updateFromDeltaFile reads the decompressed input stream until an EOF (that is marked as the integer -1 in the stream) and inserts key and value rows in the given state map: First integer is the size of a key (buffer) followed by the key itself (of the size). updateFromDeltaFile creates an UnsafeRow for the key (with the number of fields as indicated by the number of fields of the < >). Next integer is the size of a value (buffer) followed by the value itself (of the size). updateFromDeltaFile creates an UnsafeRow for the value (with the number of fields as indicated by the number of fields of the < >) or removes the corresponding key from the state map (if the value size is -1 ) NOTE: updateFromDeltaFile removes the key-value entry from the state map if the value (size) is -1 . In the end, updateFromDeltaFile prints out the following INFO message to the logs and returns the key-value map. Read delta file for version [version] of [this] from [fileToRead] updateFromDeltaFile throws an IllegalStateException in case of FileNotFoundException while opening the delta file for the specified version: Error reading delta file [fileToRead] of [this]: [fileToRead] does not exist NOTE: updateFromDeltaFile is used exclusively when HDFSBackedStateStoreProvider is requested to < >. === [[putStateIntoStateCacheMap]] Caching New Version of State -- putStateIntoStateCacheMap Internal Method [source, scala] \u00b6 putStateIntoStateCacheMap( newVersion: Long, map: ConcurrentHashMap[UnsafeRow, UnsafeRow]): Unit putStateIntoStateCacheMap registers state for a given version, i.e. adds the map state under the newVersion key in the < > internal registry.

MemorySink is intended only for testing or demos. MemorySink is used for memory format and requires a query name (by queryName method or queryName option). NOTE: MemorySink was introduced in the https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/12119[pull request for [SPARK-14288][SQL] Memory Sink for streaming]. Use toDebugString to see the batches. Its aim is to allow users to test streaming applications in the Spark shell or other local tests. You can set checkpointLocation using option method or it will be set to spark-sql-streaming-properties.md#spark-sql-streaming-properties.md[spark.sql.streaming.checkpointLocation] property. If spark.sql.streaming.checkpointLocation is set, the code uses $location/$queryName directory. Finally, when no spark.sql.streaming.checkpointLocation is set, a temporary directory memory.stream under java.io.tmpdir is used with offsets subdirectory inside. NOTE: The directory is cleaned up at shutdown using ShutdownHookManager.registerShutdownDeleteDir . It creates MemorySink instance based on the schema of the DataFrame it operates on. It creates a new DataFrame using MemoryPlan with MemorySink instance created earlier and registers it as a temporary table (using spark-sql-dataframe.md#registerTempTable[DataFrame.registerTempTable] method). NOTE: At this point you can query the table as if it were a regular non-streaming table using spark-sql-sqlcontext.md#sql[sql] method. A new spark-sql-streaming-StreamingQuery.md[StreamingQuery] is started (using spark-sql-streaming-StreamingQueryManager.md#startQuery[StreamingQueryManager.startQuery]) and returned.

TIP: Monitor offsets and commits metadata logs to know the progress of a streaming query. StreamExecution < > for 10 milliseconds (when no data was available to process in a batch). Use spark-sql-streaming-properties.md#spark.sql.streaming.pollingDelay[spark.sql.streaming.pollingDelay] Spark property to control the delay. [[id]] Every StreamExecution is uniquely identified by an ID of the streaming query (which is the id of the < >). NOTE: Since the < > is persisted (to the metadata file in the < >), the streaming query ID \"survives\" query restarts as long as the checkpoint directory is preserved. [[runId]] StreamExecution is also uniquely identified by a run ID of the streaming query . A run ID is a randomly-generated 128-bit universally unique identifier (UUID) that is assigned at the time StreamExecution is created. NOTE: runId does not \"survive\" query restarts and will always be different yet unique (across all active queries). [NOTE] \u00b6 The < >, < > and < > are all unique across all active queries (in a < >). The difference is that: < > is optional and user-defined < > is a UUID that is auto-generated at the time StreamExecution is created and persisted to metadata checkpoint file * < > is a UUID that is auto-generated every time StreamExecution is created \u00b6 [[streamMetadata]] StreamExecution uses a < > that is < > in the metadata file in the < >. If the metadata file is available it is < > and is the way to recover the < > of a streaming query when resumed (i.e. restarted after a failure or a planned stop). [[IS_CONTINUOUS_PROCESSING]] StreamExecution uses __is_continuous_processing local property (default: false ) to differentiate between < > ( true ) and < > ( false ) which is used when StateStoreRDD is requested to < > (and < > for a given version). [[logging]] [TIP] ==== Enable ALL logging level for org.apache.spark.sql.execution.streaming.StreamExecution to see what happens inside.

The given < > is defined using checkpointLocation option or the < > configuration property with queryName option. checkpointLocation and queryName options are defined when StreamingQueryManager is requested to < >. resolvedCheckpointRoot is used when < > and when StreamExecution finishes < >. resolvedCheckpointRoot is used for the < > (while transforming < > and planning StreamingRelation logical operators to corresponding StreamingExecutionRelation physical operators with the streaming data sources created passing in the path to sources directory to store checkpointing metadata). [TIP] \u00b6 You can see resolvedCheckpointRoot in the INFO message when StreamExecution is < >. Starting [prettyIdString]. Use [resolvedCheckpointRoot] to store the query checkpoint. \u00b6 Internally, resolvedCheckpointRoot creates a Hadoop org.apache.hadoop.fs.Path for < > and makes it qualified. NOTE: resolvedCheckpointRoot uses SparkSession to access SessionState for a Hadoop configuration. === [[commitLog]] Offset Commit Log -- commits Metadata Checkpoint Directory StreamExecution uses offset commit log (< > with commits < >) for streaming batches successfully executed (with a single file per batch with a file name being the batch id) or committed epochs. NOTE: Metadata log or metadata checkpoint are synonyms and are often used interchangeably. commitLog is used by the < > for the following: MicroBatchExecution is requested to < > (that in turn requests to < > at the very beginning of the streaming query execution and later regularly every < >) ContinuousExecution is requested to < > (that in turn requests to < > at the very beginning of the streaming query execution and later regularly every < >) === [[lastExecution]] Last Query Execution Of Streaming Query (IncrementalExecution) -- lastExecution Property [source, scala] \u00b6 lastExecution: IncrementalExecution \u00b6 NOTE: lastExecution is part of the < > for the QueryExecution of a streaming query. lastExecution is a < > (a QueryExecution of a streaming query) of the most recent ( last ) execution. lastExecution is created when the < > are requested for the following: MicroBatchExecution is requested to < > (when in < >) ContinuousExecution stream execution engine is requested to < > (when in < >) lastExecution is used when: StreamExecution is requested to < > (via < >) ProgressReporter is requested to < >, < >, and < > MicroBatchExecution stream execution engine is requested to < > (based on < >), < > (when in < > and < >) ContinuousExecution stream execution engine is requested to < > (when in < >) For debugging query execution of streaming queries (using debugCodegen ) === [[explain]] Explaining Streaming Query -- explain Method [source, scala] \u00b6 explain(): Unit // <1> explain(extended: Boolean): Unit <1> Turns the extended flag off ( false ) explain simply prints out < > to the standard output.

The fluent API of DataStreamReader allows you to describe the input data source (e.g. DataStreamReader.format and DataStreamReader.options ) using method chaining (with the goal of making the readability of the source code close to that of ordinary written prose, essentially creating a domain-specific language within the interface. See Fluent interface article in Wikipedia). reader . format ( \"csv\" ) . option ( \"delimiter\" , \"|\" ) There are a couple of built-in data source formats. Their names are the names of the corresponding DataStreamReader methods and so act like shortcuts of DataStreamReader.format (where you have to specify the format by name), i.e. csv , json , orc , parquet and text , followed by DataStreamReader.load . You may also want to use DataStreamReader.schema method to specify the schema of the streaming data source. reader . schema ( \"a INT, b STRING\" ) In the end, you use DataStreamReader.load method that simply creates a streaming Dataset (the good ol' Dataset that you may have already used in Spark SQL). val input = reader . format ( \"csv\" ) . option ( \"delimiter\" , \"\\t\" ) . schema ( \"word STRING, num INT\" ) . load ( \"data/streaming\" ) import org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame assert ( input . isInstanceOf [ DataFrame ]) The Dataset has the isStreaming property enabled that is basically the only way you could distinguish streaming Datasets from regular, batch Datasets. assert ( input . isStreaming ) In other words, Spark Structured Streaming is designed to extend the features of Spark SQL and let your structured queries be streaming queries. Data Source Resolution, Streaming Dataset and Logical Query Plan \u00b6 Whenever you create a Dataset (be it batch in Spark SQL or streaming in Spark Structured Streaming) is when you create a logical query plan using the High-Level Dataset DSL . A logical query plan is made up of logical operators. Spark Structured Streaming gives you two logical operators to represent streaming sources ( StreamingRelationV2 and StreamingRelation ). When DataStreamReader.load method is executed, load first looks up the requested data source (that you specified using DataStreamReader.format ) and creates an instance of it ( instantiation ). That'd be data source resolution step (that I described in...FIXME). DataStreamReader.load is where you can find the intersection of the former Micro-Batch Stream Processing V1 API with the new Continuous Stream Processing V2 API. V2 Code Path \u00b6 For MicroBatchReadSupport or ContinuousReadSupport data sources, DataStreamReader.load creates a logical query plan with a StreamingRelationV2 leaf logical operator. That is the new V2 code path . // rate data source is V2 val rates = spark.readStream.format(\"rate\").load val plan = rates.queryExecution.logical scala> println(plan.numberedTreeString) 00 StreamingRelationV2 org.apache.spark.sql.execution.streaming.sources.RateStreamProvider@2ed03b1a, rate, [timestamp#12, value#13L] V1 Code Path \u00b6 For all other types of streaming data sources, DataStreamReader.load creates a logical query plan with a StreamingRelation leaf logical operator.

Again, the distinction between Spark SQL and Spark Structured Streaming is very thin from a developer's point of view. DataStreamWriter and Streaming Data Sink \u00b6 Once you're satisfied with building a stream processing pipeline (using the APIs of DataStreamReader , Dataset , RelationalGroupedDataset and KeyValueGroupedDataset ), you should define how and when the result of the streaming query is persisted in ( sent out to ) an external data system using a streaming sink . You should use Dataset.writeStream method that simply creates a DataStreamWriter . // Not only is this a Dataset, but it is also streaming assert(countByTime.isStreaming) val writer = countByTime.writeStream import org.apache.spark.sql.streaming.DataStreamWriter assert(writer.isInstanceOf[DataStreamWriter[_]]) The fluent API of DataStreamWriter allows you to describe the output data sink ( DataStreamWriter.format and DataStreamWriter.options ) using method chaining (with the goal of making the readability of the source code close to that of ordinary written prose, essentially creating a domain-specific language within the interface. See Fluent interface article in Wikipedia). writer .format(\"csv\") .option(\"delimiter\", \"\\t\") Like in DataStreamReader data source formats, there are a couple of built-in data sink formats. Unlike data source formats, their names do not have corresponding DataStreamWriter methods. The reason is that you will use DataStreamWriter.start to create and immediately start a StreamingQuery . There are however two special output formats that do have corresponding DataStreamWriter methods, i.e. DataStreamWriter.foreach and DataStreamWriter.foreachBatch , that allow for persisting query results to external data systems that do not have streaming sinks available. They give you a trade-off between developing a full-blown streaming sink and simply using the methods (that lay the basis of what a custom sink would have to do anyway). DataStreamWriter API defines two new concepts (that are not available in the \"base\" Spark SQL): OutputMode that you specify using DataStreamWriter.outputMode method Trigger that you specify using DataStreamWriter.trigger method You may also want to give a streaming query a name using DataStreamWriter.queryName method. In the end, you use DataStreamWriter.start method to create and immediately start a StreamingQuery . import org.apache.spark.sql.streaming.OutputMode import org.apache.spark.sql.streaming.Trigger import scala.concurrent.duration._ val sq = writer .format(\"console\") .option(\"truncate\", false) .option(\"checkpointLocation\", \"/tmp/csv-to-csv-checkpoint\") .outputMode(OutputMode.Append) .trigger(Trigger.ProcessingTime(30.seconds)) .queryName(\"csv-to-csv\") .start(\"/tmp\") import org.apache.spark.sql.streaming.StreamingQuery assert(sq.isInstanceOf[StreamingQuery]) When DataStreamWriter is requested to start a streaming query , it allows for the following data source formats: memory with MemorySinkV2 (with ContinuousTrigger ) or MemorySink foreach with ForeachWriterProvider sink foreachBatch with ForeachBatchSink sink (that does not support ContinuousTrigger ) Any DataSourceRegister data source Custom data sources specified by their fully-qualified class names or [name].DefaultSource avro , kafka and some others (see DataSource.lookupDataSource object method) StreamWriteSupport DataSource is requested to create a streaming sink that accepts StreamSinkProvider or FileFormat data sources only With a streaming sink, DataStreamWriter requests the StreamingQueryManager to start a streaming query .

Executing Physical Operator \u00b6 doExecute () : RDD [ InternalRow ] doExecute first initializes the metrics (which happens on the driver). doExecute then requests the child physical operator to execute (and generate an RDD[InternalRow] ). doExecute uses StateStoreOps to create a StateStoreRDD with a storeUpdateFunction that does the following (for a partition): Creates an InputProcessor for a given StateStore (only when the GroupStateTimeout is EventTimeTimeout ) Filters out late data based on the event-time watermark , i.e. rows from a given Iterator[InternalRow] that are older than the event-time watermark are excluded from the steps that follow Requests the InputProcessor to create an iterator of a new data processed from the (possibly filtered) iterator Requests the InputProcessor to create an iterator of a timed-out state data Creates an iterator by concatenating the above iterators (with the new data processed first) In the end, creates a CompletionIterator that executes a completion function ( completionFunction ) after it has successfully iterated through all the elements (i.e. when a client has consumed all the rows).

FlatMapGroupsWithStateExec uses the GroupStateTimeout (and possibly the updated metadata ) when asked whether to run another batch or not (when MicroBatchExecution is requested to construct the next streaming micro-batch when requested to run the activated streaming query ). Streaming Event-Time Watermark Support \u00b6 FlatMapGroupsWithStateExec is a physical operator that supports streaming event-time watermark . FlatMapGroupsWithStateExec is given the optional event time watermark when created. The event-time watermark is initially undefined ( None ) when planned for execution (in FlatMapGroupsWithStateStrategy execution planning strategy). Note FlatMapGroupsWithStateStrategy converts FlatMapGroupsWithState unary logical operator to FlatMapGroupsWithStateExec physical operator with undefined StatefulOperatorStateInfo , batchTimestampMs , and eventTimeWatermark . The event-time watermark (with the StatefulOperatorStateInfo and the batchTimestampMs ) is only defined to the current event-time watermark of the given OffsetSeqMetadata when IncrementalExecution query execution pipeline is requested to apply the state preparation rule (as part of the preparations rules). Note The preparations rules are executed (applied to a physical query plan) at the executedPlan phase of Structured Query Execution Pipeline to generate an optimized physical query plan ready for execution). Read up on Structured Query Execution Pipeline in The Internals of Spark SQL online book. IncrementalExecution is used as the lastExecution of the available streaming query execution engines . It is created in the queryPlanning phase (of the MicroBatchExecution and ContinuousExecution execution engines) based on the current OffsetSeqMetadata . Note The optional event-time watermark can only be defined when the state preparation rule is executed which is at the executedPlan phase of Structured Query Execution Pipeline which is also part of the queryPlanning phase. StateManager \u00b6 stateManager : StateManager While being created, FlatMapGroupsWithStateExec creates a StateManager (with the state encoder and the isTimeoutEnabled flag). A StateManager is created per state format version that is given while creating a FlatMapGroupsWithStateExec (to choose between the available implementations ). The state format version is controlled by spark.sql.streaming.flatMapGroupsWithState.stateFormatVersion internal configuration property. The StateManager is used exclusively when FlatMapGroupsWithStateExec physical operator is executed for the following: State schema (for the value schema of a StateStoreRDD ) State data for a key in a StateStore while processing new data All state data (for all keys) in a StateStore while processing timed-out state data Removing the state for a key from a StateStore when all rows have been processed Persisting the state for a key in a StateStore when all rows have been processed keyExpressions Method \u00b6 keyExpressions : Seq [ Attribute ] keyExpressions simply returns the grouping attributes . keyExpressions is part of the WatermarkSupport abstraction. Checking Out Whether Last Batch Execution Requires Another Non-Data Batch or Not \u00b6 shouldRunAnotherBatch ( newMetadata : OffsetSeqMetadata ) : Boolean shouldRunAnotherBatch uses the GroupStateTimeout as follows: With EventTimeTimeout , shouldRunAnotherBatch is true only when the event-time watermark is defined and is older (below) the event-time watermark of the given OffsetSeqMetadata With NoTimeout (and other GroupStateTimeouts if there were any), shouldRunAnotherBatch is always false With ProcessingTimeTimeout , shouldRunAnotherBatch is always true shouldRunAnotherBatch is part of the StateStoreWriter abstraction.

The StateManager is used exclusively when FlatMapGroupsWithStateExec physical operator is executed for the following: State schema (for the value schema of a StateStoreRDD ) State data for a key in a StateStore while processing new data All state data (for all keys) in a StateStore while processing timed-out state data Removing the state for a key from a StateStore when all rows have been processed Persisting the state for a key in a StateStore when all rows have been processed","title":" StateManager"},{"location":"physical-operators/FlatMapGroupsWithStateExec/#keyexpressions-method","text":"keyExpressions : Seq [ Attribute ] keyExpressions simply returns the grouping attributes . keyExpressions is part of the WatermarkSupport abstraction.","title":" keyExpressions Method"},{"location":"physical-operators/FlatMapGroupsWithStateExec/#checking-out-whether-last-batch-execution-requires-another-non-data-batch-or-not","text":"shouldRunAnotherBatch ( newMetadata : OffsetSeqMetadata ) : Boolean shouldRunAnotherBatch uses the GroupStateTimeout as follows: With EventTimeTimeout , shouldRunAnotherBatch is true only when the event-time watermark is defined and is older (below) the event-time watermark of the given OffsetSeqMetadata With NoTimeout (and other GroupStateTimeouts if there were any), shouldRunAnotherBatch is always false With ProcessingTimeTimeout , shouldRunAnotherBatch is always true shouldRunAnotherBatch is part of the StateStoreWriter abstraction.","title":" Checking Out Whether Last Batch Execution Requires Another Non-Data Batch or Not"},{"location":"physical-operators/FlatMapGroupsWithStateExec/#internal-properties","text":"","title":"Internal Properties"},{"location":"physical-operators/FlatMapGroupsWithStateExec/#istimeoutenabled-flag","text":"Flag that says whether the GroupStateTimeout is not NoTimeout Used when: FlatMapGroupsWithStateExec is created (and creates the internal StateManager ) InputProcessor is requested to processTimedOutState","title":" isTimeoutEnabled Flag"},{"location":"physical-operators/FlatMapGroupsWithStateExec/#watermarkpresent-flag","text":"Flag that says whether the child physical operator has a watermark attribute (among the output attributes).
