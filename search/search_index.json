If the offsets at the current and previous epochs are the same, addOffset turns the noNewData internal flag on. addOffset then acquires the awaitProgressLock , wakes up all threads waiting for the awaitProgressLockCondition and in the end releases the awaitProgressLock .

Next integer is the size of a value (buffer) followed by the value itself (of the size). readSnapshotFile creates an UnsafeRow for the value (with the number of fields as indicated by the number of fields of the < >). In the end, readSnapshotFile prints out the following INFO message to the logs and returns the key-value map. Read snapshot file for version [version] of [this] from [fileToRead] In case of FileNotFoundException readSnapshotFile simply returns None (to indicate no snapshot state file was available and so no state for the version). readSnapshotFile throws an IOException for the size of a key or a value below 0 : Error reading snapshot file [fileToRead] of [this]: [key|value] size cannot be [keySize|valueSize] NOTE: readSnapshotFile is used exclusively when HDFSBackedStateStoreProvider is requested to < >. === [[updateFromDeltaFile]] Updating State with State Changes For Specified Version (per Delta File) -- updateFromDeltaFile Internal Method [source, scala] \u00b6 updateFromDeltaFile( version: Long, map: ConcurrentHashMap[UnsafeRow, UnsafeRow]): Unit [NOTE] \u00b6 updateFromDeltaFile is very similar code-wise to < > with the two main differences: updateFromDeltaFile is given the state map to update (while < > loads the state from a snapshot file) updateFromDeltaFile removes a key from the state map when the value (size) is -1 (while < > throws an IOException ) The following description is almost an exact copy of < > just for completeness. \u00b6 updateFromDeltaFile < > for the requested version . updateFromDeltaFile requests the < > to open the delta file for reading and < > ( input ). updateFromDeltaFile reads the decompressed input stream until an EOF (that is marked as the integer -1 in the stream) and inserts key and value rows in the given state map: First integer is the size of a key (buffer) followed by the key itself (of the size). updateFromDeltaFile creates an UnsafeRow for the key (with the number of fields as indicated by the number of fields of the < >). Next integer is the size of a value (buffer) followed by the value itself (of the size). updateFromDeltaFile creates an UnsafeRow for the value (with the number of fields as indicated by the number of fields of the < >) or removes the corresponding key from the state map (if the value size is -1 ) NOTE: updateFromDeltaFile removes the key-value entry from the state map if the value (size) is -1 . In the end, updateFromDeltaFile prints out the following INFO message to the logs and returns the key-value map. Read delta file for version [version] of [this] from [fileToRead] updateFromDeltaFile throws an IllegalStateException in case of FileNotFoundException while opening the delta file for the specified version: Error reading delta file [fileToRead] of [this]: [fileToRead] does not exist NOTE: updateFromDeltaFile is used exclusively when HDFSBackedStateStoreProvider is requested to < >. === [[putStateIntoStateCacheMap]] Caching New Version of State -- putStateIntoStateCacheMap Internal Method [source, scala] \u00b6 putStateIntoStateCacheMap( newVersion: Long, map: ConcurrentHashMap[UnsafeRow, UnsafeRow]): Unit putStateIntoStateCacheMap registers state for a given version, i.e. adds the map state under the newVersion key in the < > internal registry. With the < > threshold as 0 or below, putStateIntoStateCacheMap simply removes all entries from the < > internal registry and returns. putStateIntoStateCacheMap removes the oldest state version(s) in the < > internal registry until its size is at the < > threshold. With the size of the < > internal registry is at the < > threshold, putStateIntoStateCacheMap does two more optimizations per newVersion It does not add the given state when the version of the oldest state is earlier (larger) than the given newVersion It removes the oldest state when older (smaller) than the given newVersion NOTE: putStateIntoStateCacheMap is used when HDFSBackedStateStoreProvider is requested to < > and < >. === [[writeSnapshotFile]] Writing Compressed Snapshot File for Specified Version -- writeSnapshotFile Internal Method [source, scala] \u00b6 writeSnapshotFile( version: Long, map: ConcurrentHashMap[UnsafeRow, UnsafeRow]): Unit writeSnapshotFile < > for the given version. writeSnapshotFile requests the < > to create the snapshot file (with overwriting enabled) and < >. For every key-value UnsafeRow pair in the given map, writeSnapshotFile writes the size of the key followed by the key itself (as bytes). writeSnapshotFile then writes the size of the value followed by the value itself (as bytes). In the end, writeSnapshotFile prints out the following INFO message to the logs: Written snapshot file for version [version] of [this] at [targetFile] In case of any Throwable exception, writeSnapshotFile < > and re-throws the exception.

A new entry (a version and the state updates) can only be added when HDFSBackedStateStoreProvider is requested to < > (and only when the spark.sql.streaming.maxBatchesToRetainInMemory internal configuration is above 0 ). loadedMaps is mainly used when HDFSBackedStateStoreProvider is requested to < >. Positive hits (when a version could be found in the cache) is available as the < > performance metric while misses are counted in the < > performance metric. NOTE: With no or missing versions in cache < > metric should be above 0 while < > always 0 (or smaller than the other metric). The estimated size of loadedMaps is available as the < > performance metric. The spark.sql.streaming.maxBatchesToRetainInMemory internal configuration is used as the threshold of the number of elements in loadedMaps .

Preparing Logical Plan (of Streaming Query) for Execution \u00b6 When requested for the optimized logical plan (of the logical plan ), IncrementalExecution transforms CurrentBatchTimestamp and ExpressionWithRandomSeed expressions with the timestamp literal and new random seeds, respectively. When transforming CurrentBatchTimestamp expressions, IncrementalExecution prints out the following INFO message to the logs: Current batch timestamp = [timestamp] Right after being created , IncrementalExecution is executed (in the queryPlanning phase by the MicroBatchExecution and ContinuousExecution stream execution engines) and so the entire query execution pipeline is executed up to and including executedPlan . That means that the extra planning strategies and the state preparation rule have been applied at this point and the streaming query is ready for execution. Creating Instance \u00b6 IncrementalExecution takes the following to be created: SparkSession LogicalPlan OutputMode (as specified using DataStreamWriter.outputMode method) State checkpoint location ID of a streaming query Run ID of a streaming query Batch ID OffsetSeqMetadata IncrementalExecution is created (and becomes the StreamExecution.lastExecution ) when: MicroBatchExecution is requested to run a single streaming micro-batch (in queryPlanning phase) ContinuousExecution is requested to run a streaming query in continuous mode (in queryPlanning phase) Dataset.explain operator is executed (on a streaming query) State Checkpoint Location \u00b6 IncrementalExecution is given the checkpoint location when created .

Tip Learn more about spark.sql.shuffle.partitions configuration property in The Internals of Spark SQL online book. Internally, numStateStores requests the OffsetSeqMetadata for the spark.sql.shuffle.partitions configuration property (using the streaming configuration ) or simply takes whatever was defined for the given SparkSession (default: 200 ). numStateStores is initialized right when IncrementalExecution is created . numStateStores is used when IncrementalExecution is requested for the state info of the next stateful operator (when requested to optimize a streaming physical plan using the state preparation rule that creates the stateful physical operators: StateStoreSaveExec , StateStoreRestoreExec , StreamingDeduplicateExec , FlatMapGroupsWithStateExec , StreamingSymmetricHashJoinExec , and StreamingGlobalLimitExec ).

State Preparation Rule For Execution-Specific Configuration \u00b6 state : Rule [ SparkPlan ] state is a custom physical preparation rule ( Rule[SparkPlan] ) that can transform a streaming physical plan ( SparkPlan ) with the following physical operators: StateStoreSaveExec with any unary physical operator ( UnaryExecNode ) with a StateStoreRestoreExec StreamingDeduplicateExec FlatMapGroupsWithStateExec StreamingSymmetricHashJoinExec StreamingGlobalLimitExec state simply transforms the physical plan with the above physical operators and fills out the execution-specific configuration: nextStatefulOperationStateInfo for the state info OutputMode batchWatermarkMs (through the OffsetSeqMetadata ) for the event-time watermark batchTimestampMs (through the OffsetSeqMetadata ) for the current timestamp getStateWatermarkPredicates for the state watermark predicates (for StreamingSymmetricHashJoinExec ) state rule is used (as part of the physical query optimizations) when IncrementalExecution is requested to optimize (prepare) the physical plan of the streaming query (once for ContinuousExecution and every trigger for MicroBatchExecution in queryPlanning phase). Tip Learn more about Physical Query Optimizations in The Internals of Spark SQL online book. Next StatefulOperationStateInfo \u00b6 nextStatefulOperationStateInfo () : StatefulOperatorStateInfo nextStatefulOperationStateInfo simply creates a new StatefulOperatorStateInfo with the state checkpoint location , the run ID (of the streaming query), the next statefulOperator ID , the current batch ID , and the number of state stores . Note The only changing part of StatefulOperatorStateInfo across calls of the nextStatefulOperationStateInfo method is the the next statefulOperator ID . All the other properties (the state checkpoint location , the run ID , the current batch ID , and the number of state stores ) are the same within a single IncrementalExecution instance. The only two properties that may ever change are the run ID (after a streaming query is restarted from the checkpoint) and the current batch ID (every micro-batch in MicroBatchExecution execution engine). nextStatefulOperationStateInfo is used when IncrementalExecution is requested to optimize a streaming physical plan using the state preparation rule (and creates the stateful physical operators: StateStoreSaveExec , StateStoreRestoreExec , StreamingDeduplicateExec , FlatMapGroupsWithStateExec , StreamingSymmetricHashJoinExec , and StreamingGlobalLimitExec ). Checking Out Whether Last Execution Requires Another Non-Data Micro-Batch \u00b6 shouldRunAnotherBatch ( newMetadata : OffsetSeqMetadata ) : Boolean shouldRunAnotherBatch is positive ( true ) if there is at least one StateStoreWriter operator (in the executedPlan physical query plan ) that requires another non-data batch (per the given OffsetSeqMetadata with the event-time watermark and the batch timestamp). Otherwise, shouldRunAnotherBatch is negative ( false ). shouldRunAnotherBatch is used when MicroBatchExecution is requested to construct the next streaming micro-batch (and checks out whether the last batch execution requires another non-data batch).

Creating Instance \u00b6 InputProcessor takes the following to be created: StateStore InputProcessor is created when FlatMapGroupsWithStateExec physical operator is executed (for storeUpdateFunction while processing rows per partition with a corresponding per-partition state store). StateStore \u00b6 InputProcessor is given a StateStore when created . The StateStore manages the per-group state (and is used when processing new data and timed-out state data , and in the \"all rows processed\" callback ). Processing New Data \u00b6 processNewData ( dataIter : Iterator [ InternalRow ]) : Iterator [ InternalRow ] processNewData creates a grouped iterator of (of pairs of) per-group state keys and the row values from the given data iterator ( dataIter ) with the grouping attributes and the output schema of the child operator (of the parent FlatMapGroupsWithStateExec physical operator). For every per-group state key (in the grouped iterator), processNewData requests the StateManager (of the parent FlatMapGroupsWithStateExec physical operator) to get the state (from the StateStore ) and callFunctionAndUpdateState (with the hasTimedOut flag off). processNewData is used when FlatMapGroupsWithStateExec physical operator is executed. Processing Timed-Out State Data \u00b6 processTimedOutState () : Iterator [ InternalRow ] processTimedOutState does nothing and simply returns an empty iterator for GroupStateTimeout.NoTimeout . With timeout enabled , processTimedOutState gets the current timeout threshold per GroupStateTimeout : batchTimestampMs for ProcessingTimeTimeout eventTimeWatermark for EventTimeTimeout processTimedOutState creates an iterator of timed-out state data by requesting the StateManager for all the available state data (in the StateStore ) and takes only the state data with timeout defined and below the current timeout threshold. In the end, for every timed-out state data, processTimedOutState callFunctionAndUpdateState (with the hasTimedOut flag on). processTimedOutState is used when FlatMapGroupsWithStateExec physical operator is executed. callFunctionAndUpdateState Internal Method \u00b6 callFunctionAndUpdateState ( stateData : StateData , valueRowIter : Iterator [ InternalRow ], hasTimedOut : Boolean ) : Iterator [ InternalRow ] callFunctionAndUpdateState is used when InputProcessor is requested to process new data and timed-out state data with the given hasTimedOut flag is off and on, respectively. callFunctionAndUpdateState creates a key object by requesting the given StateData for the UnsafeRow of the key ( keyRow ) and converts it to an object (using the internal state key converter ). callFunctionAndUpdateState creates value objects by taking every value row (from the given valueRowIter iterator) and converts them to objects (using the internal state value converter ). callFunctionAndUpdateState creates a new GroupStateImpl with the following: The current state value (of the given StateData ) that could possibly be null The batchTimestampMs of the parent FlatMapGroupsWithStateExec operator (that could possibly be -1 ) The event-time watermark of the parent FlatMapGroupsWithStateExec operator (that could possibly be -1 ) The GroupStateTimeout of the parent FlatMapGroupsWithStateExec operator The watermarkPresent flag of the parent FlatMapGroupsWithStateExec operator The given hasTimedOut flag callFunctionAndUpdateState then executes the user-defined state function (of the parent FlatMapGroupsWithStateExec operator) on the key object, value objects, and the newly-created GroupStateImpl . For every output value from the user-defined state function, callFunctionAndUpdateState updates numOutputRows performance metric and wraps the values to an internal row (using the internal output value converter ). In the end, callFunctionAndUpdateState returns a Iterator[InternalRow] which calls the completion function right after rows have been processed (so the iterator is considered fully consumed). \"All Rows Processed\" Callback \u00b6 onIteratorCompletion : Unit onIteratorCompletion branches off per whether the GroupStateImpl has been marked removed and no timeout timestamp is specified or not.

Requests the StateManager (of the parent FlatMapGroupsWithStateExec operator) to remove the state (from the StateStore for the key row of the given StateData ) .

NOTE: runBatch requests sources and readers for data per offset range sequentially, one by one. .StreamExecution's Running Single Streaming Batch (getBatch Phase) image::images/StreamExecution-runBatch-getBatch.png[align=\"center\"] getBatch Phase and Sources \u00b6 For a Source (with the available offset s different from the committedOffsets registry), runBatch does the following: Requests the committedOffsets for the committed offsets for the Source (if available) Requests the Source for a dataframe for the offset range (the current and available offsets) runBatch prints out the following DEBUG message to the logs. Retrieving data from [source]: [current] -> [available] In the end, runBatch returns the Source and the logical plan of the streaming dataset (for the offset range). In case the Source returns a dataframe that is not streaming, runBatch throws an AssertionError : DataFrame returned by getBatch from [source] did not have isStreaming=true\\n[logicalQueryPlan] getBatch Phase and MicroBatchReaders \u00b6 For a < > (with the available offset s different from the committedOffsets registry), runBatch does the following: Requests the committedOffsets for the committed offsets for the MicroBatchReader (if available) Requests the MicroBatchReader to < > (if available) Requests the MicroBatchReader to < > (only for SerializedOffset s) Requests the MicroBatchReader to < > (the current and available offsets) runBatch prints out the following DEBUG message to the logs.

For every StreamingExecutionRelation , runBatch tries to find the corresponding logical plan for processing new data. If the logical plan is found, runBatch makes the plan a child operator of Project (with Aliases ) logical operator and replaces the StreamingExecutionRelation . Otherwise, if not found, runBatch simply creates an empty streaming LocalRelation (for scanning data from an empty local collection). In case the number of columns in dataframes with new data and StreamingExecutionRelation 's do not match, runBatch throws an AssertionError : Invalid batch: [output] != [dataPlan.output] Transforming CurrentTimestamp and CurrentDate Expressions (Per Batch Metadata) \u00b6 runBatch replaces all CurrentTimestamp and CurrentDate expressions in the < > with the current batch timestamp (based on the batch metadata ).

TIP: Read up on the executedPlan query execution phase in https://jaceklaskowski.gitbooks.io/mastering-spark-sql/spark-sql-QueryExecution.html[The Internals of Spark SQL]. nextBatch Phase \u2014 Creating DataFrame (with IncrementalExecution for New Data) \u00b6 runBatch creates a new DataFrame with the new < >. The DataFrame represents the result of executing the current micro-batch of the streaming query. addBatch Phase \u2014 Adding DataFrame With New Data to Sink \u00b6 In addBatch time-tracking section , runBatch adds the DataFrame with new data to the BaseStreamingSink . For a Sink (Data Source API V1), runBatch simply requests the Sink to add the DataFrame (with the batch ID ). runBatch uses SQLExecution.withNewExecutionId to execute and track all the Spark jobs under one execution id (so it is reported as one single multi-job execution, e.g. in web UI). Note SQLExecution.withNewExecutionId posts a SparkListenerSQLExecutionStart event before execution and a SparkListenerSQLExecutionEnd event right afterwards. Tip Register SparkListener to get notified about the SQL execution events ( SparkListenerSQLExecutionStart and SparkListenerSQLExecutionEnd ). Updating Watermark and Committing Offsets to Offset Commit Log \u00b6 runBatch requests the WatermarkTracker to update event-time watermark (with the executedPlan of the IncrementalExecution ). runBatch requests the Offset Commit Log to persisting metadata of the streaming micro-batch (with the current batch ID and event-time watermark of the WatermarkTracker ). In the end, runBatch adds the available offsets to the committed offsets (and updates the offset s of every source with new data in the current micro-batch). Stopping Stream Processing (Execution of Streaming Query) \u00b6 stop () : Unit stop sets the state to TERMINATED . When the stream execution thread is alive, stop requests the current SparkContext to cancelJobGroup identified by the runId and waits for this thread to die. Just to make sure that there are no more streaming jobs, stop requests the current SparkContext to cancelJobGroup identified by the runId again. In the end, stop prints out the following INFO message to the logs: Query [prettyIdString] was stopped stop is part of the StreamingQuery abstraction. === [[isNewDataAvailable]] Checking Whether New Data Is Available (Based on Available and Committed Offsets) -- isNewDataAvailable Internal Method [source, scala] \u00b6 isNewDataAvailable: Boolean \u00b6 isNewDataAvailable checks whether there is a streaming source (in the < >) for which < > are different from the available offsets or not available (committed) at all. isNewDataAvailable is positive ( true ) when there is at least one such streaming source. NOTE: isNewDataAvailable is used when MicroBatchExecution is requested to < > and < >. Analyzed Logical Plan \u00b6 logicalPlan : LogicalPlan logicalPlan is part of the StreamExecution abstraction. logicalPlan resolves ( replaces ) StreamingRelation , StreamingRelationV2 logical operators to StreamingExecutionRelation logical operators. logicalPlan uses the transformed logical plan to set the uniqueSources and < > internal registries to be the BaseStreamingSources of all the StreamingExecutionRelations unique and not, respectively. Lazy Value logicalPlan is a Scala lazy value to guarantee that the code to initialize it is executed once only (when accessed for the first time) and cached afterwards. Internally, logicalPlan transforms the < >. For every StreamingRelation logical operator, logicalPlan tries to replace it with the StreamingExecutionRelation that was used earlier for the same StreamingRelation (if used multiple times in the plan) or creates a new one. While creating a new StreamingExecutionRelation , logicalPlan requests the DataSource to create a streaming Source with the metadata path as sources/uniqueID directory in the checkpoint root directory . logicalPlan prints out the following INFO message to the logs: Using Source [source] from DataSourceV1 named '[sourceName]' [dataSourceV1] For every StreamingRelationV2 logical operator with a MicroBatchStream data source (which is not on the list of spark.sql.streaming.disabledV2MicroBatchReaders ), logicalPlan tries to replace it with the StreamingExecutionRelation that was used earlier for the same StreamingRelationV2 (if used multiple times in the plan) or creates a new one. While creating a new StreamingExecutionRelation , logicalPlan requests the MicroBatchStream to create a MicroBatchStream with the metadata path as sources/uniqueID directory in the checkpoint root directory . logicalPlan prints out the following INFO message to the logs: Using MicroBatchReader [reader] from DataSourceV2 named '[sourceName]' [dataSourceV2] For every other StreamingRelationV2 leaf logical operator, logicalPlan tries to replace it with the StreamingExecutionRelation that was used earlier for the same StreamingRelationV2 (if used multiple times in the plan) or creates a new one. While creating a new StreamingExecutionRelation , logicalPlan requests the StreamingRelation for the underlying DataSource that is in turn requested to create a streaming Source with the metadata path as sources/uniqueID directory in the checkpoint root directory . logicalPlan prints out the following INFO message to the logs: Using Source [source] from DataSourceV2 named '[sourceName]' [dataSourceV2] logicalPlan requests the transformed analyzed logical plan for all StreamingExecutionRelations that are then requested for BaseStreamingSources , and saves them as the < > internal registry.

The difference is that: name is optional and user-defined id is a UUID that is auto-generated at the time StreamExecution is created and persisted to metadata checkpoint file runId is a UUID that is auto-generated every time StreamExecution is created Id \u00b6 StreamExecution is uniquely identified by an ID of the streaming query (which is the id of the StreamMetadata ). Since the StreamMetadata is persisted (to the metadata file in the checkpoint directory ), the streaming query ID \"survives\" query restarts as long as the checkpoint directory is preserved. Run Id \u00b6 StreamExecution is uniquely identified by a run ID of the streaming query . A run ID is a randomly-generated 128-bit universally unique identifier (UUID) that is assigned at the time StreamExecution is created. runId does not \"survive\" query restarts and will always be different yet unique (across all active queries). StreamMetadata \u00b6 StreamExecution uses a StreamMetadata that is persisted in the metadata file in the checkpoint directory . If the metadata file is available it is read and is the way to recover the id of a streaming query when resumed (i.e. restarted after a failure or a planned stop). Metadata Logs \u00b6 Write-Ahead Offset Log \u00b6 offsetLog : OffsetSeqLog offsetLog is a Hadoop DFS-based metadata storage (of OffsetSeq s) with offsets metadata directory . offsetLog is used as a Write-Ahead Log of Offsets to persist offsets of the data about to be processed in every trigger. Tip Monitor offsets and commits metadata logs to know the progress of a streaming query. The number of entries in the OffsetSeqLog is controlled using spark.sql.streaming.minBatchesToRetain configuration property. offsetLog is used when: ContinuousExecution stream execution engine is requested to commit an epoch , getStartOffsets , and addOffset MicroBatchExecution stream execution engine is requested to populate start offsets and construct (or skip) the next streaming micro-batch Offset Commit Log \u00b6 StreamExecution uses offset commit log ( CommitLog with commits metadata checkpoint directory ) for streaming batches successfully executed (with a single file per batch with a file name being the batch id) or committed epochs. Note Metadata log or metadata checkpoint are synonyms and are often used interchangeably. commitLog is used by the < > for the following: MicroBatchExecution is requested to < > (that in turn requests to < > at the very beginning of the streaming query execution and later regularly every < >) ContinuousExecution is requested to < > (that in turn requests to < > at the very beginning of the streaming query execution and later regularly every < >) State of Streaming Query \u00b6 state : AtomicReference [ State ] state indicates the internal state of execution of the streaming query (as java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicReference ). ACTIVE \u00b6 StreamExecution has been requested to < > (and is about to < >) INITIALIZING \u00b6 StreamExecution has been created . TERMINATED \u00b6 Indicates that: MicroBatchExecution has been requested to stop ContinuousExecution has been requested to stop StreamExecution has been requested to run stream processing (and has finished running the activated streaming query ) RECONFIGURING \u00b6 Used when ContinuousExecution is requested to run a streaming query in continuous mode (and the ContinuousReader indicated a need for reconfiguration ) Creating StreamingWrite \u00b6 createStreamingWrite ( table : SupportsWrite , options : Map [ String , String ], inputPlan : LogicalPlan ) : StreamingWrite createStreamingWrite creates a LogicalWriteInfoImpl (with the query ID , the schema of the input LogicalPlan and the given options). createStreamingWrite requests the given SupportsWrite table for a WriteBuilder (for the LogicalWriteInfoImpl ). Tip Learn more about SupportsWrite and WriteBuilder in The Internals of Spark SQL online book. createStreamingWrite branches based on the OutputMode : For Append output mode, createStreamingWrite requests the WriteBuilder to build a StreamingWrite . For Complete output mode, createStreamingWrite assumes that the WriteBuilder is a SupportsTruncate and requests it to truncate followed by buildForStreaming For Update output mode, createStreamingWrite assumes that the WriteBuilder is a SupportsStreamingUpdate and requests it to update followed by buildForStreaming Tip Learn more about SupportsTruncate and SupportsStreamingUpdate in The Internals of Spark SQL online book. createStreamingWrite is used when MicroBatchExecution and ContinuousExecution stream execution engines are requested for analyzed logical plans. Available Offsets (StreamProgress) \u00b6 availableOffsets : StreamProgress availableOffsets is a registry of offsets per streaming source to track what data (by offset ) is available for processing for every streaming source in the streaming query (and have not yet been committed ). availableOffsets works in tandem with the committedOffsets internal registry. availableOffsets is empty when StreamExecution is created (i.e. no offsets are reported for any streaming source in the streaming query). availableOffsets is used when: MicroBatchExecution stream execution engine is requested to < >, < >, < > and < > ContinuousExecution stream execution engine is requested to commit an epoch StreamExecution is requested for the internal string representation Committed Offsets (StreamProgress) \u00b6 committedOffsets : StreamProgress committedOffsets is a registry of offsets per streaming source to track what data (by offset ) has already been processed and committed (to the sink or state stores) for every streaming source in the streaming query . committedOffsets works in tandem with the availableOffsets internal registry. committedOffsets is used when: MicroBatchExecution stream execution engine is requested for the < >, to < > and < > ContinuousExecution stream execution engine is requested for the < > and to < > StreamExecution is requested for the internal string representation Fully-Qualified (Resolved) Path to Checkpoint Root Directory \u00b6 resolvedCheckpointRoot : String resolvedCheckpointRoot is a fully-qualified path of the given checkpoint root directory . The given checkpoint root directory is defined using checkpointLocation option or the spark.sql.streaming.checkpointLocation configuration property with queryName option. checkpointLocation and queryName options are defined when StreamingQueryManager is requested to create a streaming query . resolvedCheckpointRoot is used when creating the path to the checkpoint directory and when StreamExecution finishes running streaming batches . resolvedCheckpointRoot is used for the logicalPlan (while transforming analyzedPlan and planning StreamingRelation logical operators to corresponding StreamingExecutionRelation physical operators with the streaming data sources created passing in the path to sources directory to store checkpointing metadata). resolvedCheckpointRoot is printed out immediately when resolved as a INFO message to the logs: Checkpoint root [checkpointRoot] resolved to [resolvedCheckpointRoot]. resolvedCheckpointRoot is printed out again as a INFO message to the logs when StreamExecution is started : Starting [prettyIdString]. Use [resolvedCheckpointRoot] to store the query checkpoint. StreamWriterCommitProgress \u00b6 sinkCommitProgress : Option [ StreamWriterCommitProgress ] sinkCommitProgress is part of the ProgressReporter abstraction. StreamExecution initializes sinkCommitProgress registry to be None when created . Last Query Execution Of Streaming Query (IncrementalExecution) \u00b6 lastExecution : IncrementalExecution lastExecution is part of the ProgressReporter abstraction. lastExecution is a IncrementalExecution (a QueryExecution of a streaming query) of the most recent ( last ) execution. lastExecution is created when the < > are requested for the following: MicroBatchExecution is requested to < > (when in < >) ContinuousExecution stream execution engine is requested to < > (when in < >) lastExecution is used when: StreamExecution is requested to < > (via < >) ProgressReporter is requested to extractStateOperatorMetrics , extractExecutionStats , and extractSourceToNumInputRows MicroBatchExecution stream execution engine is requested to < > (based on StateStoreWriters in a streaming query ), < > (when in < > and < >) ContinuousExecution stream execution engine is requested to < > (when in < >) For debugging query execution of streaming queries (using debugCodegen ) Explaining Streaming Query \u00b6 explain () : Unit // <1> explain ( extended: Boolean ) : Unit <1> Turns the extended flag off ( false ) explain simply prints out < > to the standard output. Stopping Streaming Sources and Readers \u00b6 stopSources () : Unit stopSources requests every streaming source to stop. In case of an non-fatal exception, stopSources prints out the following WARN message to the logs: Failed to stop streaming source: [source]. Resources may have leaked. stopSources is used when: StreamExecution is requested to < > (and < > successfully or not) ContinuousExecution is requested to < > (and terminates) Running Stream Processing \u00b6 runStream () : Unit runStream simply prepares the environment to execute the activated streaming query . runStream is used when the stream execution thread is requested to start (when DataStreamWriter is requested to start an execution of the streaming query ). Internally, runStream sets the job group (to all the Spark jobs started by this thread) as follows: runId for the job group ID getBatchDescriptionString for the job group description (to display in web UI) interruptOnCancel flag on Note runStream uses the SparkSession to access SparkContext and assign the job group id. Learn more about SparkContext.setJobGroup method in The Internals of Apache Spark online book. runStream sets sql.streaming.queryId local property to id . runStream requests the MetricsSystem to register the MetricsReporter when spark.sql.streaming.metricsEnabled configuration property is enabled. runStream notifies StreamingQueryListeners that the streaming query has been started (by posting a new QueryStartedEvent event with id , runId , and name ). runStream unblocks the main starting thread (by decrementing the count of the startLatch that when 0 lets the starting thread continue). runStream updates the status message to be Initializing sources . runStream initializes the analyzed logical plan . Lazy Value The analyzed logical plan is a Scala lazy value to guarantee that the code to initialize it is executed once only (when accessed for the first time) and cached afterwards. runStream disables adaptive query execution and cost-based join optimization (by turning spark.sql.adaptive.enabled and spark.sql.cbo.enabled configuration properties off, respectively). runStream creates a new \"zero\" OffsetSeqMetadata . (when in INITIALIZING state) runStream enters ACTIVE state: Decrements the count of initializationLatch Executes the activated streaming query Note runBatches does the main work only when first started (when in INITIALIZING state). runStream ...FIXME (describe the failed and stop states) Once TriggerExecutor has finished executing batches, runBatches updates the status message to Stopped . NOTE: TriggerExecutor finishes executing batches when the batch runner returns whether the streaming query is stopped or not (while active ). finally Block \u00b6 runStream releases the startLatch and initializationLatch latches. runStream stopSources . runStream enters TERMINATED state. runStream sets the StreamingQueryStatus with the isTriggerActive and isDataAvailable flags off ( false ). runStream removes the stream metrics reporter from the application's MetricsSystem . runStream requests the StreamingQueryManager to handle termination of a streaming query . runStream creates a new QueryTerminatedEvent (with the id and run id of the streaming query) and posts it . With the deleteCheckpointOnStop flag enabled and no StreamingQueryException , runStream deletes the checkpoint directory . In the end, runStream releases the terminationLatch latch. TriggerExecutor's Batch Runner \u00b6 Batch Runner ( batchRunner ) is an executable block executed by TriggerExecutor in runBatches . batchRunner starts trigger calculation . As long as the query is not stopped (i.e. state is not TERMINATED ), batchRunner executes the streaming batch for the trigger. In triggerExecution time-tracking section , runBatches branches off per currentBatchId : For currentBatchId < 0 : populateStartOffsets Setting Job Description as getBatchDescriptionString Stream running from [committedOffsets] to [availableOffsets] For currentBatchId >= 0 : Constructing the next streaming micro-batch If there is data available in the sources, batchRunner marks currentStatus with isDataAvailable enabled. Tip You can check out the status of a streaming query using status method. scala> spark.streams.active(0).status res1: org.apache.spark.sql.streaming.StreamingQueryStatus = { \"message\" : \"Waiting for next trigger\", \"isDataAvailable\" : false, \"isTriggerActive\" : false } batchRunner then updates the status message to Processing new data and runs the current streaming batch . After triggerExecution section has finished, batchRunner finishes the streaming batch for the trigger (and collects query execution statistics). When there was < > in the sources, batchRunner updates committed offsets (by adding the < > to BatchCommitLog and adding availableOffsets to committedOffsets ). batchRunner prints out the following DEBUG message to the logs: batch [currentBatchId] committed batchRunner increments the current batch id and sets the job description for all the following Spark jobs to include the new batch id . When no data was available in the sources to process, batchRunner does the following: Marks currentStatus with isDataAvailable disabled Updates the status message to Waiting for data to arrive Sleeps the current thread for pollingDelayMs milliseconds. batchRunner updates the status message to Waiting for next trigger and returns whether the query is currently active or not (so TriggerExecutor can decide whether to finish executing the batches or not) Starting Streaming Query (on Stream Execution Thread) \u00b6 start () : Unit start starts a stream execution thread that simply runs stream processing (and hence the streaming query). start prints out the following INFO message to the logs: Starting [prettyIdString]. Use [resolvedCheckpointRoot] to store the query checkpoint. start then starts the < > (as a daemon thread). NOTE: start uses Java's ++ https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Thread.html#start--++[java.lang.Thread.start ] to run the streaming query on a separate execution thread. NOTE: When started, a streaming query runs in its own execution thread on JVM. In the end, start pauses the main thread (using the < > until StreamExecution is requested to < > that in turn sends a < > to all streaming listeners followed by decrementing the count of the < >). start is used when StreamingQueryManager is requested to start a streaming query (when DataStreamWriter is requested to start an execution of the streaming query ). Path to Checkpoint Directory \u00b6 checkpointFile ( name : String ) : String checkpointFile gives the path of a directory with name in checkpoint directory . checkpointFile is used for streamMetadata , OffsetSeqLog , BatchCommitLog , and lastExecution (for runBatch ). Posting StreamingQueryListener Event \u00b6 postEvent ( event : StreamingQueryListener.Event ) : Unit postEvent is a part of the ProgressReporter abstraction. postEvent simply requests the StreamingQueryManager to post the input event (to the StreamingQueryListenerBus in the current SparkSession ). Note postEvent uses SparkSession to access the current StreamingQueryManager . postEvent is used when: ProgressReporter is requested to report update progress (while finishing a trigger ) StreamExecution runs streaming batches (and announces starting a streaming query by posting a QueryStartedEvent and query termination by posting a QueryTerminatedEvent ) Waiting Until No New Data Available in Sources or Query Has Been Terminated \u00b6 processAllAvailable () : Unit processAllAvailable is a part of the StreamingQuery abstraction. processAllAvailable reports the < > if reported (and returns immediately). NOTE: < > is reported exclusively when StreamExecution is requested to < > (that terminated with an exception). processAllAvailable returns immediately when StreamExecution is no longer < > (in TERMINATED state). processAllAvailable acquires a lock on the < > and turns the < > internal flag off ( false ). processAllAvailable keeps polling with 10-second pauses (locked on < >) until < > flag is turned on ( true ) or StreamExecution is no longer < > (in TERMINATED state). NOTE: The 10-second pause is hardcoded and cannot be changed. In the end, processAllAvailable releases < > lock. processAllAvailable throws an IllegalStateException when executed on the < >: Cannot wait for a query state from the same thread that is running the query Stream Execution Thread \u00b6 queryExecutionThread : QueryExecutionThread queryExecutionThread is a Java thread of execution ( java.util.Thread ) that runs a streaming query . queryExecutionThread is started (as a daemon thread) when StreamExecution is requested to < >. At that time, start prints out the following INFO message to the logs (with the < > and the < >): Starting [prettyIdString]. Use [resolvedCheckpointRoot] to store the query checkpoint. When started, queryExecutionThread sets the < > and < >. queryExecutionThread uses the name stream execution thread for [id] (that uses < > for the id, i.e. queryName [id = [id], runId = [runId]] ). queryExecutionThread is a QueryExecutionThread that is a custom UninterruptibleThread from Apache Spark with runUninterruptibly method for running a block of code without being interrupted by Thread.interrupt() . Tip Use Java's jconsole or jstack to monitor stream execution threads. $ jstack <driver-pid> | grep -e \"stream execution thread\" \"stream execution thread for kafka-topic1 [id =... Current Batch Metadata (Event-Time Watermark and Timestamp) \u00b6 offsetSeqMetadata : OffsetSeqMetadata offsetSeqMetadata is a OffsetSeqMetadata . offsetSeqMetadata is used to create an IncrementalExecution in the queryPlanning phase of the MicroBatchExecution and ContinuousExecution execution engines. offsetSeqMetadata is initialized (with 0 for batchWatermarkMs and batchTimestampMs ) when StreamExecution is requested to < >. offsetSeqMetadata is then updated (with the current event-time watermark and timestamp) when MicroBatchExecution is requested to < >. NOTE: MicroBatchExecution uses the < > for the current event-time watermark and the < > for the current batch timestamp. offsetSeqMetadata is stored ( checkpointed ) in < > of MicroBatchExecution (and printed out as INFO message to the logs). offsetSeqMetadata is restored ( re-created ) from a checkpointed state when MicroBatchExecution is requested to < >. offsetSeqMetadata is part of the ProgressReporter abstraction. isActive \u00b6 isActive : Boolean isActive is part of the StreamingQuery abstraction. isActive is enabled ( true ) as long as the State is not TERMINATED . Human-Readable HTML Description of Spark Jobs (for web UI) \u00b6 getBatchDescriptionString : String getBatchDescriptionString is a human-readable description (in HTML format) that uses the optional name if defined, the < >, the < > and batchDescription that can be init (for the < > negative) or the current batch ID itself. getBatchDescriptionString is of the following format: [name] id = [id] runId = [runId] batch = [batchDescription] getBatchDescriptionString is used when: MicroBatchExecution stream execution engine is requested to < > (as the job description of any Spark jobs triggerred as part of query execution) StreamExecution is requested to < > (as the job group description of any Spark jobs triggerred as part of query execution) No New Data Available \u00b6 noNewData : Boolean noNewData is a flag that indicates that a batch has completed with no new data left and processAllAvailable could stop waiting till all streaming data is processed. Default: false Turned on ( true ) when: MicroBatchExecution stream execution engine is requested to < > (while < >) ContinuousExecution stream execution engine is requested to < > Turned off ( false ) when: MicroBatchExecution stream execution engine is requested to < > (right after the < > phase) StreamExecution is requested to < > Current Batch ID \u00b6 -1 when StreamExecution is created 0 when StreamExecution populates start offsets (and OffsetSeqLog is empty, i.e. no offset files in offsets directory in checkpoint) Incremented when StreamExecution runs streaming batches and finishes a trigger that had data available from sources (right after committing the batch ). newData Registry \u00b6 newData : Map [ BaseStreamingSource , LogicalPlan ] Registry of the streaming sources (in the logical query plan ) that have new data available in the current batch. The new data is a streaming DataFrame . newData is part of the ProgressReporter abstraction. Set when StreamExecution is requested to requests unprocessed data from streaming sources (while running a single streaming batch ) Used when StreamExecution is requested to transform the logical plan (of the streaming query) to include the Sources and the MicroBatchReaders with new data (while running a single streaming batch ) Streaming Metrics \u00b6 StreamExecution uses MetricsReporter for reporting streaming metrics. MetricsReporter is created with the following source name (with name if defined or id ): spark.streaming.[name or id] MetricsReporter is registered only when spark.sql.streaming.metricsEnabled configuration property is enabled (when StreamExecution is requested to runStream ). MetricsReporter is deactivated ( removed ) when a streaming query is stopped (when StreamExecution is requested to runStream ). Latches \u00b6 StreamExecution uses java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch es (with count 1 ). initializationLatch \u00b6 Counted down when requested to runStream : Changes state from INITIALIZING to ACTIVE just before runActivatedStream In runStream's finally block Awaited for tests only (which seems to indicate that it is a test-only latch) startLatch \u00b6 Counted down when requested to runStream : Right after posting a QueryStartedEvent In runStream's finally block Awaited when requested to start (to pause the main thread until StreamExecution was requested to run the streaming query on a separate thread) terminationLatch \u00b6 Counted down at the end of runStream Awaited when requested to awaitTermination (that pauses the thread until the streaming query has finished successfully or not). Locks \u00b6 awaitProgressLock \u00b6 StreamExecution uses a fair reentrant mutual exclusion java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock (that favors granting access to the longest-waiting thread under contention) __is_continuous_processing Local Property \u00b6 StreamExecution uses __is_continuous_processing local property (default: false ) to differentiate between < > ( true ) and < > ( false ) which is used when StateStoreRDD is requested to compute a partition (and < > for a given version). Logging \u00b6 Enable ALL logging level for org.apache.spark.sql.execution.streaming.StreamExecution logger to see what happens inside.

That makes the tasks (of a structured query) to be scheduled where the state (of a partition) is. When planned for execution, the StateStoreRDD is first asked for the preferred locations of a partition (which happens on the driver) that are later used to compute it (on Spark executors). Spark Structured Streaming uses RPC environment to keep track of StateStore s (their StateStoreProvider actually) for RDD planning. Every time StateStoreRDD is requested for the preferred locations of a partition , it communicates with the StateStoreCoordinator RPC endpoint that knows the locations of the required StateStores (per host and executor ID). StateStoreRDD uses StateStoreProviderId with StateStoreId to uniquely identify the state store to use for ( associate with ) a stateful operator and a partition.

Data Source Resolution, Streaming Dataset and Logical Query Plan \u00b6 Whenever you create a Dataset (be it batch in Spark SQL or streaming in Spark Structured Streaming) is when you create a logical query plan using the High-Level Dataset DSL . A logical query plan is made up of logical operators. Spark Structured Streaming gives you two logical operators to represent streaming sources ( StreamingRelationV2 and StreamingRelation ). When DataStreamReader.load method is executed, load first looks up the requested data source (that you specified using DataStreamReader.format ) and creates an instance of it ( instantiation ).

There are however two special output formats that do have corresponding DataStreamWriter methods, i.e. DataStreamWriter.foreach and DataStreamWriter.foreachBatch , that allow for persisting query results to external data systems that do not have streaming sinks available. They give you a trade-off between developing a full-blown streaming sink and simply using the methods (that lay the basis of what a custom sink would have to do anyway). DataStreamWriter API defines two new concepts (that are not available in the \"base\" Spark SQL): OutputMode that you specify using DataStreamWriter.outputMode method Trigger that you specify using DataStreamWriter.trigger method You may also want to give a streaming query a name using DataStreamWriter.queryName method.

Streaming queries can be expressed using a high-level declarative streaming API ( Dataset API ) or good ol' SQL ( SQL over stream / streaming SQL ). The declarative streaming Dataset API and SQL are executed on the underlying highly-optimized Spark SQL engine. The semantics of the Structured Streaming model is as follows (see the article Structured Streaming In Apache Spark ): At any time, the output of a continuous application is equivalent to executing a batch job on a prefix of the data. As of Spark 2.2.0, Structured Streaming has been marked stable and ready for production use. With that the other older streaming module Spark Streaming is considered obsolete and not for developing new streaming applications with Apache Spark. Spark Structured Streaming comes with two stream execution engines for executing streaming queries: MicroBatchExecution for Micro-Batch Stream Processing ContinuousExecution for Continuous Stream Processing The goal of Spark Structured Streaming is to unify streaming, interactive, and batch queries over structured datasets for developing end-to-end stream processing applications dubbed continuous applications using Spark SQL's Datasets API with additional support for the following features: Streaming Aggregation Streaming Join Streaming Watermark Arbitrary Stateful Streaming Aggregation Stateful Stream Processing In Structured Streaming, Spark developers describe custom streaming computations in the same way as with Spark SQL. Internally, Structured Streaming applies the user-defined structured query to the continuously and indefinitely arriving data to analyze real-time streaming data.

Structured Streaming models a stream of data as an infinite (and hence continuous) table that could be changed every streaming batch. You can specify output mode of a streaming dataset which is what gets written to a streaming sink (i.e. the infinite result table) when there is a new data available. Streaming Datasets use streaming query plans (as opposed to regular batch Datasets that are based on batch query plans). Note From this perspective, batch queries can be considered streaming Datasets executed once only (and is why some batch queries, e.g. KafkaSource , can easily work in batch mode). val batchQuery = spark . read . format ( \"rate\" ). load assert ( batchQuery . isStreaming == false ) val streamingQuery = spark . readStream . format ( \"rate\" ). load assert ( streamingQuery . isStreaming ) With Structured Streaming, Spark 2 aims at simplifying streaming analytics with little to no need to reason about effective data streaming (trying to hide the unnecessary complexity in your streaming analytics architectures). Structured streaming is defined by the following data abstractions in org.apache.spark.sql.streaming package: StreamingQuery Streaming Source Streaming Sink StreamingQueryManager Structured Streaming follows micro-batch model and periodically fetches data from the data source (and uses the DataFrame data abstraction to represent the fetched data for a certain batch). With Datasets as Spark SQL's view of structured data, structured streaming checks input sources for new data every trigger (time) and executes the (continuous) queries. Note The feature has also been called Streaming Spark SQL Query , Streaming DataFrames , Continuous DataFrame or Continuous Query .

A Dataset is streaming when its logical plan is streaming. val batchQuery = spark . read . // <-- batch non-streaming query csv ( \"sales\" ) assert ( batchQuery . isStreaming == false ) val streamingQuery = spark . readStream . // <-- streaming query format ( \"rate\" ). load assert ( streamingQuery . isStreaming ) Note Read up on Spark SQL, Datasets and logical plans in The Internals of Spark SQL online book. Structured Streaming models a stream of data as an infinite (and hence continuous) table that could be changed every streaming batch. You can specify output mode of a streaming dataset which is what gets written to a streaming sink (i.e. the infinite result table) when there is a new data available. Streaming Datasets use streaming query plans (as opposed to regular batch Datasets that are based on batch query plans). Note From this perspective, batch queries can be considered streaming Datasets executed once only (and is why some batch queries, e.g. KafkaSource , can easily work in batch mode). val batchQuery = spark . read . format ( \"rate\" ). load assert ( batchQuery . isStreaming == false ) val streamingQuery = spark . readStream . format ( \"rate\" ). load assert ( streamingQuery . isStreaming ) With Structured Streaming, Spark 2 aims at simplifying streaming analytics with little to no need to reason about effective data streaming (trying to hide the unnecessary complexity in your streaming analytics architectures). Structured streaming is defined by the following data abstractions in org.apache.spark.sql.streaming package: StreamingQuery Streaming Source Streaming Sink StreamingQueryManager Structured Streaming follows micro-batch model and periodically fetches data from the data source (and uses the DataFrame data abstraction to represent the fetched data for a certain batch). With Datasets as Spark SQL's view of structured data, structured streaming checks input sources for new data every trigger (time) and executes the (continuous) queries. Note The feature has also been called Streaming Spark SQL Query , Streaming DataFrames , Continuous DataFrame or Continuous Query . There have been lots of names before the Spark project settled on Structured Streaming.","title":"Spark Structured Streaming and Streaming Queries"},{"location":"spark-structured-streaming/#references","text":"","title":"References"},{"location":"spark-structured-streaming/#articles","text":"SPARK-8360 Structured Streaming (aka Streaming DataFrames) The official Structured Streaming Programming Guide Structured Streaming In Apache Spark What Spark's Structured Streaming really means","title":"Articles"},{"location":"spark-structured-streaming/#videos","text":"The Future of Real Time in Spark from Spark Summit East 2016 in which Reynold Xin presents the concept of Streaming DataFrames Structuring Spark: DataFrames, Datasets, and Streaming A Deep Dive Into Structured Streaming by Tathagata \"TD\" Das from Spark Summit 2016 Arbitrary Stateful Aggregations in Structured Streaming in Apache Spark by Burak Yavuz","title":"Videos"},{"location":"streaming-aggregation/","text":"Streaming Aggregation \u00b6 In Spark Structured Streaming, a streaming aggregation is a streaming query that was described ( build ) using the following high-level streaming operators : Dataset.groupBy , Dataset.rollup , Dataset.cube (that simply create a RelationalGroupedDataset ) Dataset.groupByKey (that simply creates a KeyValueGroupedDataset ) SQL's GROUP BY clause (including WITH CUBE and WITH ROLLUP ) Streaming aggregation belongs to the category of Stateful Stream Processing . === [[IncrementalExecution]] IncrementalExecution -- QueryExecution of Streaming Queries Under the covers, the high-level operators create a logical query plan with one or more Aggregate logical operators.

You're very welcome to upvote the question and answers at your earliest convenience. Thanks! \u00b6 Quoting the https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.4/dev/event_time.html[Apache Flink documentation]: Event time is the time that each individual event occurred on its producing device. This time is typically embedded within the records before they enter Flink and that event timestamp can be extracted from the record. That is exactly how event time is considered in withWatermark operator which you use to describe what column to use for event time. The column could be part of the input dataset or...generated. And that is the moment where my confusion starts. In order to generate the event time column for withWatermark operator you could use current_timestamp or current_date standard functions.

In the end, extractExecutionStats creates a ExecutionStats with the execution statistics. If the input hasNewData flag is turned off ( false ), extractExecutionStats returns an ExecutionStats with no input rows and event-time statistics (that require data to be processed to have any sense). NOTE: extractExecutionStats is used exclusively when ProgressReporter is requested to < >. Generating StateStoreWriter Metrics (StateOperatorProgress) \u00b6 extractStateOperatorMetrics ( hasNewData : Boolean ) : Seq [ StateOperatorProgress ] extractStateOperatorMetrics requests the < > for the optimized execution plan ( executedPlan ) and finds all StateStoreWriter physical operators and requests them for StateOperatorProgress . extractStateOperatorMetrics clears ( zeros ) the numRowsUpdated metric for the given hasNewData turned off ( false ). extractStateOperatorMetrics returns an empty collection for the < > uninitialized ( null ). extractStateOperatorMetrics is used when ProgressReporter is requested to generate execution statistics .

How/where is it used? on StackOverflow. Creating Instance \u00b6 FlatMapGroupsWithStateExec takes the following to be created: User-defined state function that is applied to every group (of type (Any, Iterator[Any], LogicalGroupState[Any]) => Iterator[Any] ) Deserializer expression for keys Deserializer expression for values Grouping attributes (as used for grouping in KeyValueGroupedDataset for mapGroupsWithState or flatMapGroupsWithState operators) Data attributes Output object attribute (that is the reference to the single object field this operator outputs) Optional StatefulOperatorStateInfo State encoder ( ExpressionEncoder[Any] ) State format version OutputMode GroupStateTimeout Optional Batch Processing Time Optional Event-Time Watermark Child physical operator FlatMapGroupsWithStateExec is created when FlatMapGroupsWithStateStrategy execution planning strategy is executed (and plans a FlatMapGroupsWithState logical operator for execution). Executing Physical Operator \u00b6 doExecute () : RDD [ InternalRow ] doExecute first initializes the metrics (which happens on the driver). doExecute then requests the child physical operator to execute (and generate an RDD[InternalRow] ). doExecute uses StateStoreOps to create a StateStoreRDD with a storeUpdateFunction that does the following (for a partition): Creates an InputProcessor for a given StateStore (only when the GroupStateTimeout is EventTimeTimeout ) Filters out late data based on the event-time watermark , i.e. rows from a given Iterator[InternalRow] that are older than the event-time watermark are excluded from the steps that follow Requests the InputProcessor to create an iterator of a new data processed from the (possibly filtered) iterator Requests the InputProcessor to create an iterator of a timed-out state data Creates an iterator by concatenating the above iterators (with the new data processed first) In the end, creates a CompletionIterator that executes a completion function ( completionFunction ) after it has successfully iterated through all the elements (i.e. when a client has consumed all the rows).

Streaming Event-Time Watermark Support \u00b6 FlatMapGroupsWithStateExec is a physical operator that supports streaming event-time watermark . FlatMapGroupsWithStateExec is given the optional event time watermark when created. The event-time watermark is initially undefined ( None ) when planned for execution (in FlatMapGroupsWithStateStrategy execution planning strategy). Note FlatMapGroupsWithStateStrategy converts FlatMapGroupsWithState unary logical operator to FlatMapGroupsWithStateExec physical operator with undefined StatefulOperatorStateInfo , batchTimestampMs , and eventTimeWatermark .

StateManager \u00b6 stateManager : StateManager While being created, FlatMapGroupsWithStateExec creates a StateManager (with the state encoder and the isTimeoutEnabled flag). A StateManager is created per state format version that is given while creating a FlatMapGroupsWithStateExec (to choose between the available implementations ). The state format version is controlled by spark.sql.streaming.flatMapGroupsWithState.stateFormatVersion internal configuration property. The StateManager is used exclusively when FlatMapGroupsWithStateExec physical operator is executed for the following: State schema (for the value schema of a StateStoreRDD ) State data for a key in a StateStore while processing new data All state data (for all keys) in a StateStore while processing timed-out state data Removing the state for a key from a StateStore when all rows have been processed Persisting the state for a key in a StateStore when all rows have been processed keyExpressions Method \u00b6 keyExpressions : Seq [ Attribute ] keyExpressions simply returns the grouping attributes . keyExpressions is part of the WatermarkSupport abstraction.

Executing Physical Operator \u00b6 doExecute () : RDD [ InternalRow ] doExecute is part of the SparkPlan abstraction ( Spark SQL ). doExecute first requests the StreamingQueryManager for the StateStoreCoordinatorRef to the StateStoreCoordinator RPC endpoint (for the driver). doExecute then uses SymmetricHashJoinStateManager utility to get the names of the state stores for the left and right sides of the streaming join. In the end, doExecute requests the < > and < > child physical operators to execute (generate an RDD) and then < > with < > (and with the StateStoreCoordinatorRef and the state stores). === [[processPartitions]] Processing Partitions of Left and Right Sides of Stream-Stream Join -- processPartitions Internal Method [source, scala] \u00b6 processPartitions( leftInputIter: Iterator[InternalRow], rightInputIter: Iterator[InternalRow]): Iterator[InternalRow] [[processPartitions-updateStartTimeNs]] processPartitions records the current time (as updateStartTimeNs for the < > performance metric in < >). [[processPartitions-postJoinFilter]] processPartitions creates a new predicate ( postJoinFilter ) based on the bothSides of the < > if defined or true literal. [[processPartitions-leftSideJoiner]] processPartitions creates a OneSideHashJoiner for the LeftSide and all other properties for the left-hand join side ( leftSideJoiner ). [[processPartitions-rightSideJoiner]] processPartitions creates a OneSideHashJoiner for the RightSide and all other properties for the right-hand join side ( rightSideJoiner ). [[processPartitions-leftOutputIter]][[processPartitions-rightOutputIter]] processPartitions requests the OneSideHashJoiner for the left-hand join side to storeAndJoinWithOtherSide with the right-hand side one (that creates a leftOutputIter row iterator) and the OneSideHashJoiner for the right-hand join side to do the same with the left-hand side one (and creates a rightOutputIter row iterator). [[processPartitions-innerOutputCompletionTimeNs]] processPartitions records the current time (as innerOutputCompletionTimeNs for the < > performance metric in < >). [[processPartitions-innerOutputIter]] processPartitions creates a CompletionIterator with the left and right output iterators (with the rows of the leftOutputIter first followed by rightOutputIter ). When no rows are left to process, the CompletionIterator records the completion time. [[processPartitions-outputIter]] processPartitions creates a join-specific output Iterator[InternalRow] of the output rows based on the < > (of the StreamingSymmetricHashJoinExec ): For Inner joins, processPartitions simply uses the < > For LeftOuter joins, processPartitions ... For RightOuter joins, processPartitions ... For other joins, processPartitions simply throws an IllegalArgumentException . [[processPartitions-outputIterWithMetrics]] processPartitions creates an UnsafeProjection for the < > (and the output of the < > and < > child operators) that counts all the rows of the < > (as the < > metric) and generate an output projection. In the end, processPartitions returns a CompletionIterator with with the < > and < > completion function. NOTE: processPartitions is used exclusively when StreamingSymmetricHashJoinExec physical operator is requested to < >. ==== [[processPartitions-onOutputCompletion]][[onOutputCompletion]] Calculating Performance Metrics (Output Completion Callback) -- onOutputCompletion Internal Method [source, scala] \u00b6 onOutputCompletion: Unit \u00b6 onOutputCompletion calculates the < > performance metric (that is the time since the < > was executed). onOutputCompletion adds the time for the inner join to complete (since < > time marker) to the < > performance metric. onOutputCompletion records the time to remove old state (per the join state watermark predicate for the < > and the < > streaming queries) and adds it to the < > performance metric.
