== [[BaseStreamingSource]] BaseStreamingSource Contract -- Base of Streaming Readers and Sources

`BaseStreamingSource` is the <<contract, abstraction>> of <<extensions, streaming readers and sources>> that can be <<stop, stopped>>.

The main purpose of `BaseStreamingSource` is to share a common abstraction between the former Data Source API V1 (<<Source, Source API>>) and the modern Data Source API V2 (until Spark Structured Streaming migrates to the Data Source API V2 fully).
