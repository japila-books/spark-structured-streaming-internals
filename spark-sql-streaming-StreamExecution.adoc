== [[StreamExecution]] StreamExecution -- Base of Streaming Query Executions

`StreamExecution` is the <<contract, base>> of <<extensions, streaming query executions>> that can <<runActivatedStream, execute>> the <<logicalPlan, structured query>> at regular intervals on a <<queryExecutionThread, stream execution thread>>.

NOTE: *Continuous query*, *streaming query*, *continuous Dataset*, *streaming Dataset* can be considered synonyms, and `StreamExecution` uses <<logicalPlan, analyzed logical plan>> internally to refer to it.

Analyzed logical plan of the streaming query to execute

Used when `StreamExecution` is requested to <<runStream, run stream processing>>

NOTE: `logicalPlan` is part of <<spark-sql-streaming-ProgressReporter.adoc#logicalPlan, ProgressReporter Contract>> and the only purpose of the `logicalPlan` property is to change the access level from `protected` to `public`.

|===

`StreamExecution` is the *execution environment* of a link:spark-sql-streaming-StreamingQuery.adoc[single continuous query] (aka _streaming Dataset_) that is executed every <<trigger, trigger>> and in the end <<runBatch-addBatch, adds the results to a sink>>.

NOTE: `StreamExecution` corresponds to a link:spark-sql-streaming-StreamingQuery.adoc[single streaming query] with one or more link:spark-sql-streaming-Source.adoc[streaming sources] and exactly one link:spark-sql-streaming-Sink.adoc[streaming sink].

.Creating Instance of StreamExecution
image::images/StreamExecution-creating-instance.png[align="center"]

NOTE: link:spark-sql-streaming-DataStreamWriter.adoc[DataStreamWriter] describes how the results of executing batches of a streaming query are written to a streaming sink.

`StreamExecution` <<start, starts a thread of execution>> that runs the streaming query continuously and concurrently (and <<runBatches, polls for new records in the streaming data sources to create a batch>> every trigger).

.StreamExecution's Starting Streaming Query (on Execution Thread)
image::images/StreamExecution-start.png[align="center"]

`StreamExecution` can be in three states:

* `INITIALIZED` when the instance was created.
* `ACTIVE` when batches are pulled from the sources.
* `TERMINATED` when executing streaming batches has been terminated due to an error, all batches were successfully processed or `StreamExecution` <<stop, has been stopped>>.

`StreamExecution` is a link:spark-sql-streaming-ProgressReporter.adoc[ProgressReporter] and <<postEvent, reports status of the streaming query>> (i.e. when it starts, progresses and terminates) by posting `StreamingQueryListener` events.

`StreamExecution` tracks streaming data sources in <<uniqueSources, uniqueSources>> internal registry.

`StreamExecution` collects `durationMs` for the execution units of streaming batches.

----

`StreamExecution` uses <<offsetLog, OffsetSeqLog>> and <<batchCommitLog, BatchCommitLog>> metadata logs for *write-ahead log* (to record offsets to be processed) and that have already been processed and committed to a streaming sink, respectively.

TIP: Monitor `offsets` and `commits` metadata logs to know the progress of a streaming query.

`StreamExecution` <<runBatches-batchRunner-no-data, delays polling for new data>> for 10 milliseconds (when no data was available to process in a batch). Use link:spark-sql-streaming-properties.adoc#spark.sql.streaming.pollingDelay[spark.sql.streaming.pollingDelay] Spark property to control the delay.

[[id]]
Every `StreamExecution` is uniquely identified by an *ID of the streaming query* (which is the `id` of the <<streamMetadata, StreamMetadata>> that is persisted in the `metadata` file in the <<checkpointFile, checkpoint directory>>).

[[streamMetadata]]
`StreamExecution` uses a <<spark-sql-streaming-StreamMetadata.adoc#, StreamMetadata>> that is <<spark-sql-streaming-StreamMetadata.adoc#write, persisted>> in the `metadata` file in the <<checkpointFile, checkpoint directory>>. If the `metadata` file is available it is <<spark-sql-streaming-StreamMetadata.adoc#read, read>> and is the way to recover the <<id, ID>> of a streaming query when resumed (i.e. restarted after a failure or a planned stop).

[cols="1m,2",options="header",width="100%"]
|===
| Name
| Description

| availableOffsets
a| [[availableOffsets]] <<spark-sql-streaming-StreamProgress.adoc#, StreamProgress>> that tracks the offsets that are available to be processed, but have not yet be committed to the sink.

NOTE: `availableOffsets` is part of the <<spark-sql-streaming-ProgressReporter.adoc#availableOffsets, ProgressReporter Contract>>.

NOTE: link:spark-sql-streaming-StreamProgress.adoc[StreamProgress] is an enhanced `immutable.Map` from Scala with streaming sources as keys and their link:spark-sql-streaming-Offset.adoc[Offsets] as values.

---

Set when (in order):

1. `StreamExecution` resumes and <<populateStartOffsets, populates the start offsets>> with the latest offsets from the <<offsetLog, offset log>> that may have already been processed (and committed to the <<batchCommitLog, batch commit log>> so they are used as the current <<committedOffsets, committed offsets>>)

1. `StreamExecution` <<constructNextBatch, constructs the next streaming batch>> (and gets offsets from the sources)

[NOTE]
====
You can see <<availableOffsets, availableOffsets>> in the DEBUG message in the logs when `StreamExecution` resumes and <<populateStartOffsets, populates the start offsets>>.

```
DEBUG Resuming at batch [currentBatchId] with committed offsets [committedOffsets] and available offsets [availableOffsets]
```
====

Used when:

* `StreamExecution` starts <<runBatches, running streaming batches>> for the first time (i.e. <<currentBatchId, current batch id>> is `-1` which is right at the initialization time)

* `StreamExecution` <<dataAvailable, checks whether a new data is available in the sources>> (and is not recorded in <<committedOffsets, committed offsets>>)

* `StreamExecution` <<constructNextBatch, constructs the next streaming batch>> (and records offsets in the <<offsetLog, write-ahead offset log>>)

* `StreamExecution` <<runBatch, runs a streaming batch>> (and fetches data from the sources that has not been processed yet, i.e. not in <<committedOffsets, committed offsets>> registry)

* `StreamExecution` finishes <<runBatches, running streaming batches>> when data was available in the sources and the offsets have just been committed to a sink (and being added to <<committedOffsets, committed offsets>> registry)

* `StreamExecution` <<toDebugString, prints out debug information>> when a streaming query has terminated due to an exception

NOTE: `availableOffsets` works in tandem with <<committedOffsets, committedOffsets>> registry.

| awaitProgressLock
| [[awaitProgressLock]] Java's fair reentrant mutual exclusion https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/locks/ReentrantLock.html[java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock] (that favors granting access to the longest-waiting thread under contention).

| awaitProgressLockCondition
| [[awaitProgressLockCondition]]

| callSite
| [[callSite]]

| commitLog
a| [[commitLog]] <<spark-sql-streaming-CommitLog.adoc#, CommitLog>> with `commits` <<checkpointFile, metadata checkpoint directory>> for completed streaming batches (with a single file per batch with a file name being the batch id).

NOTE: *Metadata log* or *metadata checkpoint* are synonyms and are often used interchangeably.

Used exclusively by the <<extensions, extensions>> for the following:

* `MicroBatchExecution` is requested to <<spark-sql-streaming-MicroBatchExecution.adoc#runActivatedStream, runActivatedStream>> when data was available and the offsets need to be committed (and does <<spark-sql-streaming-MicroBatchExecution.adoc#populateStartOffsets, populateStartOffsets>> or <<spark-sql-streaming-MicroBatchExecution.adoc#constructNextBatch, constructNextBatch>>)

* `ContinuousExecution` is requested to <<spark-sql-streaming-ContinuousExecution.adoc#getStartOffsets, getStartOffsets>>, <<spark-sql-streaming-ContinuousExecution.adoc#commit, commit>>, and <<spark-sql-streaming-ContinuousExecution.adoc#awaitEpoch, awaitEpoch>>

| committedOffsets
a| [[committedOffsets]] <<spark-sql-streaming-StreamProgress.adoc#, StreamProgress>> of the streaming sources and the committed offsets (i.e. processed already).

NOTE: `committedOffsets` is a part of link:spark-sql-streaming-ProgressReporter.adoc#committedOffsets[ProgressReporter Contract].

| currentBatchId
a| [[currentBatchId]] Current batch number

* `-1` when `StreamExecution` is <<creating-instance, created>>

* `0` when `StreamExecution` <<populateStartOffsets, populates start offsets>> (and <<offsetLog, OffsetSeqLog>> is empty, i.e. no offset files in `offsets` directory in checkpoint)

* Incremented when `StreamExecution` <<runBatches, runs streaming batches>> and finishes a trigger that had <<dataAvailable, data available from sources>> (right after <<batchCommitLog, committing the batch>>).

| initializationLatch
| [[initializationLatch]]

| lastExecution
| [[lastExecution]] Last link:spark-sql-streaming-IncrementalExecution.adoc[IncrementalExecution]

| newData
a| [[newData]]

[source, scala]
----
newData: Map[BaseStreamingSource, LogicalPlan]
----

Registry of the <<spark-sql-streaming-BaseStreamingSource.adoc#, streaming sources>> (in the <<logicalPlan, logical query plan>>) that have new data available in the current batch. The new data is a streaming `DataFrame`.

NOTE: `newData` is part of the <<spark-sql-streaming-ProgressReporter.adoc#newData, ProgressReporter Contract>>.

Set exclusively when `StreamExecution` is requested to <<runBatch-getBatch, requests unprocessed data from streaming sources>> (while <<runBatch, running a single streaming batch>>).

Used exclusively when `StreamExecution` <<runBatch-withNewSources, replaces StreamingExecutionRelations in a logical query plan with relations with new data>> (while <<runBatch, running a single streaming batch>>).

| noNewData
| [[noNewData]] Flag whether there are any new offsets available for processing or not.

Turned on (i.e. enabled) when <<constructNextBatch, constructing the next streaming batch>> when no new offsets are available.

| offsetLog
a| [[offsetLog]] link:spark-sql-streaming-OffsetSeqLog.adoc[OffsetSeqLog] with `offsets` <<checkpointFile, metadata checkpoint directory>> for *write-ahead log* to record offsets in when ready for processing.

NOTE: *Metadata log* or *metadata checkpoint* are synonyms and are often used interchangeably.

Used when `StreamExecution` <<populateStartOffsets, populates the start offsets>> and <<constructNextBatch, constructs the next streaming batch>> (first to store the current batch's offsets in a write-ahead log and retrieve the previous batch's offsets right afterwards).

NOTE: `StreamExecution` <<constructNextBatch-purge, discards offsets from the offset metadata log>> when the <<currentBatchId, current batch id>> is above link:spark-sql-streaming-properties.adoc#spark.sql.streaming.minBatchesToRetain[spark.sql.streaming.minBatchesToRetain] Spark property (which defaults to `100`).

| offsetSeqMetadata
a| [[offsetSeqMetadata]] link:spark-sql-streaming-OffsetSeqMetadata.adoc[OffsetSeqMetadata]

NOTE: `offsetSeqMetadata` is a part of link:spark-sql-streaming-ProgressReporter.adoc#offsetSeqMetadata[ProgressReporter Contract].

* Initialized with `0` for `batchWatermarkMs` and `batchTimestampMs` when `StreamExecution` is <<creating-instance, created>>.

* Updated with `0` for `batchWatermarkMs` and `batchTimestampMs` and `SparkSession` with `spark.sql.adaptive.enabled` disabled when `StreamExecution` <<runBatches, runs streaming batches>>.

* Used in...FIXME

* Copied with `batchTimestampMs` updated with the current time (in milliseconds) when `StreamExecution` <<constructNextBatch, constructs the next streaming batch>>.

| pollingDelayMs
| [[pollingDelayMs]] Time delay before polling new data again when no data was available

Set to link:spark-sql-streaming-properties.adoc#spark.sql.streaming.pollingDelay[spark.sql.streaming.pollingDelay] Spark property.

Used when `StreamExecution` has started <<runBatches, running streaming batches>> (and <<runBatches-batchRunner-no-data, no data was available to process in a trigger>>).

| prettyIdString
a| [[prettyIdString]] Pretty-identified string for identification in logs (with <<name, name>> if defined).

```
// query name set
queryName [id = xyz, runId = abc]

// no query name
[id = xyz, runId = abc]
```

| resolvedCheckpointRoot
a| [[resolvedCheckpointRoot]] Qualified path of the checkpoint directory (as defined using <<checkpointRoot, checkpointRoot>> when `StreamExecution` is <<creating-instance, created>>).

[NOTE]
====
<<checkpointRoot, checkpointRoot>> is defined using `checkpointLocation` option or link:spark-sql-streaming-properties.adoc#spark.sql.streaming.checkpointLocation[spark.sql.streaming.checkpointLocation] Spark property with `queryName` option.

`checkpointLocation` and `queryName` options are defined when `StreamingQueryManager` link:spark-sql-streaming-StreamingQueryManager.adoc#createQuery[creates a streaming query].
====

Used when <<checkpointFile, creating the path to the checkpoint directory>> and when `StreamExecution` finishes <<runBatches, running streaming batches>>.

Used for <<logicalPlan, logicalPlan>> (while transforming <<analyzedPlan, analyzedPlan>> and planning `StreamingRelation` logical operators to corresponding `StreamingExecutionRelation` physical operators with the streaming data sources created passing in the path to `sources` directory to store checkpointing metadata).

[NOTE]
====
You can see `resolvedCheckpointRoot` in the INFO message when `StreamExecution` is <<start, started>>.

```
INFO StreamExecution: Starting [id] with [resolvedCheckpointRoot] to store the query checkpoint.
```
====

Internally, `resolvedCheckpointRoot` creates a Hadoop `org.apache.hadoop.fs.Path` for <<checkpointRoot, checkpointRoot>> and makes it qualified.

NOTE: `resolvedCheckpointRoot` uses `SparkSession` to access `SessionState` for a Hadoop configuration.

| runId
| [[runId]] Current run id

| sources
| [[sources]] All link:spark-sql-streaming-Source.adoc[streaming Sources] in <<logicalPlan, logical query plan>> (that are the link:spark-sql-streaming-StreamingExecutionRelation.adoc#source[sources] from `StreamingExecutionRelation`).

| startLatch
| [[startLatch]] Java's https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/CountDownLatch.html[java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch] with count `1`.

Used when `StreamExecution` is requested to <<start, start>> to pause the main thread until `StreamExecution` was requested to <<runStream, run the streaming query>>.

| state
a| [[state]] Java's https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/atomic/AtomicReference.html[java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicReference] for the three different states a streaming query execution can be:

* `INITIALIZING` (default)
* `ACTIVE` (after the first execution of <<runBatches, runBatches>>)
* `TERMINATED`

| streamDeathCause
| [[streamDeathCause]] `StreamingQueryException`

| streamMetrics
a| [[streamMetrics]] <<spark-sql-streaming-MetricsReporter.adoc#, MetricsReporter>> with *spark.streaming.[name or id]* source name

Uses <<name, name>> if defined (can be `null`) or falls back to <<id, id>>

| uniqueSources
a| [[uniqueSources]] Unique link:spark-sql-streaming-Source.adoc[streaming data sources] in a streaming Dataset (after being collected as `StreamingExecutionRelation` from the corresponding <<logicalPlan, logical query plan>>).

NOTE: link:spark-sql-streaming-StreamingExecutionRelation.adoc[StreamingExecutionRelation] is a leaf logical operator (i.e. `LogicalPlan`) that represents a streaming data source (and corresponds to a single link:spark-sql-streaming-StreamingRelation.adoc[StreamingRelation] in <<analyzedPlan, analyzed logical query plan>> of a streaming Dataset).

Used when `StreamExecution`:

* <<constructNextBatch, Constructs the next streaming batch>> (and gets new offsets for every streaming data source)

* <<stopSources, Stops all streaming data sources>>

Internally, `runBatches` assigns the group id (to all the Spark jobs started by this thread) as <<runId, runId>> (with the group description to display in web UI as <<getBatchDescriptionString, getBatchDescriptionString>> and `interruptOnCancel` flag enabled).

[NOTE]
====
`runBatches` uses <<sparkSession, SparkSession>> to access `SparkContext` and assign the group id.

You can find the details on `SparkContext.setJobGroup` method in the https://jaceklaskowski.gitbooks.io/mastering-apache-spark/spark-SparkContext.html#setJobGroup[Mastering Apache Spark 2] gitbook.
====

`runBatches` sets a local property `sql.streaming.queryId` as <<id, id>>.

`runBatches` registers a metric source when link:spark-sql-streaming-properties.adoc#spark.sql.streaming.metricsEnabled[spark.sql.streaming.metricsEnabled] property is enabled (which is disabled by default).

CAUTION: FIXME Metrics

`runBatches` notifies `StreamingQueryListeners` that a streaming query has been started (by <<postEvent, posting a QueryStartedEvent>> with <<id, id>>, <<runId, runId>> and <<name, name>>).

.StreamingQueryListener Notified about Query's Start (onQueryStarted)
image::images/StreamingQueryListener-onQueryStarted.png[align="center"]

`runBatches` unblocks the <<start, main starting thread>> (by decrementing the count of <<startLatch, startLatch>> that goes to `0` and lets the starting thread continue).

CAUTION: FIXME A picture with two parallel lanes for the starting thread and daemon one for the query.

[[runBatches-initializing-sources]]
`runBatches` link:spark-sql-streaming-ProgressReporter.adoc#updateStatusMessage[updates the status message] to *Initializing sources* followed by initialization of the <<logicalPlan, logical plan>> (of the streaming Dataset).

`runBatches` disables adaptive query execution (using `spark.sql.adaptive.enabled` property which is disabled by default) as it could change the number of shuffle partitions.

`runBatches` initializes <<offsetSeqMetadata, offsetSeqMetadata>> internal variable.

`runBatches` sets <<state, state>> to `ACTIVE` (only when the current state is `INITIALIZING` that prevents from repeating the initialization)

NOTE: `runBatches` does the work only when first started (i.e. when <<state, state>> is `INITIALIZING`).

==== [[runBatches-batch-runner]] TriggerExecutor's Batch Runner

*Batch Runner* (aka `batchRunner`) is an executable block executed by <<triggerExecutor, TriggerExecutor>> in <<runBatches, runBatches>>.

`batchRunner` <<startTrigger, starts trigger calculation>>.

As long as the query is not stopped (i.e. <<state, state>> is not `TERMINATED`), `batchRunner` executes the streaming batch for the trigger.

In *triggerExecution* link:spark-sql-streaming-ProgressReporter.adoc#reportTimeTaken[time-tracking section], `runBatches` branches off per <<currentBatchId, currentBatchId>>.

[[runBatches-batch-runner-finishTrigger]]
After *triggerExecution* section has finished, `batchRunner` link:spark-sql-streaming-ProgressReporter.adoc#finishTrigger[finishes the streaming batch for the trigger] (and collects query execution statistics).

When there was <<dataAvailable, data available>> in the sources, `batchRunner` updates committed offsets (by link:spark-sql-streaming-CommitLog.adoc#add[adding] the <<currentBatchId, current batch id>> to <<batchCommitLog, BatchCommitLog>> and adding <<availableOffsets, availableOffsets>> to <<committedOffsets, committedOffsets>>).

You should see the following DEBUG message in the logs:

```
DEBUG batch $currentBatchId committed
```

`batchRunner` increments the <<currentBatchId, current batch id>> and sets the job description for all the following Spark jobs to <<getBatchDescriptionString, include the new batch id>>.

[[runBatches-batchRunner-no-data]]
When no <<dataAvailable, data was available>> in the sources to process, `batchRunner` does the following:

1. Marks <<currentStatus, currentStatus>> with `isDataAvailable` disabled

1. link:spark-sql-streaming-ProgressReporter.adoc#updateStatusMessage[Updates the status message] to *Waiting for data to arrive*

1. Sleeps the current thread for <<pollingDelayMs, pollingDelayMs>> milliseconds.

`batchRunner` link:spark-sql-streaming-ProgressReporter.adoc#updateStatusMessage[updates the status message] to *Waiting for next trigger* and returns whether the query is currently active or not (so <<triggerExecutor, TriggerExecutor>> can decide whether to finish executing the batches or not)

`start` then starts the <<queryExecutionThread, queryExecutionThread>> as a daemon thread.

NOTE: `start` uses Java's link:++https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Thread.html#start--++[java.lang.Thread.start] to run the streaming query on a separate execution thread.

NOTE: When started, a streaming query runs in its own execution thread on JVM.

In the end, `start` pauses the main thread (using the <<startLatch, startLatch>> until `StreamExecution` was requested to <<runStream, run the streaming query>>).

NOTE: `start` is used exclusively when `StreamingQueryManager` is requested to <<spark-sql-streaming-StreamingQueryManager.adoc#startQuery, start a streaming query>>.

=== [[creating-instance]] Creating StreamExecution Instance

`StreamExecution` takes the following when created:

* [[sparkSession]] `SparkSession`
* [[name]] Query name
* [[checkpointRoot]] Path of the checkpoint directory (aka _metadata directory_)
* [[analyzedPlan]] Analyzed logical query plan (i.e. `LogicalPlan`)
* [[sink]] <<spark-sql-streaming-Sink.adoc#, Streaming sink>>
* [[trigger]] <<spark-sql-streaming-Trigger.adoc#, Trigger>>
* [[triggerClock]] `Clock`
* [[outputMode]] <<spark-sql-streaming-OutputMode.adoc#, Output mode>> (that is only used when creating `IncrementalExecution` for a streaming batch in <<runBatch-queryPlanning, query planning>>)
* [[deleteCheckpointOnStop]] `deleteCheckpointOnStop` flag to control whether to delete the checkpoint directory on stop

`StreamExecution` initializes the <<internal-registries, internal registries and counters>>.

NOTE: `StreamExecution` is a Scala abstract class and cannot be <<creating-instance, created>> directly. It is created indirectly when the <<extensions, concrete StreamExecutions>> are.

=== [[checkpointFile]] Creating Path to Checkpoint Directory -- `checkpointFile` Internal Method

[source, scala]
----
checkpointFile(name: String): String
----

`checkpointFile` gives the path of a directory with `name` in <<resolvedCheckpointRoot, checkpoint directory>>.

NOTE: `checkpointFile` uses Hadoop's `org.apache.hadoop.fs.Path`.

NOTE: `checkpointFile` is used for <<streamMetadata, streamMetadata>>, <<offsetLog, OffsetSeqLog>>, <<batchCommitLog, BatchCommitLog>>, and <<lastExecution, lastExecution>> (for <<runBatch, runBatch>>).

=== [[postEvent]] Posting StreamingQueryListener Event -- `postEvent` Method

[source, scala]
----
postEvent(event: StreamingQueryListener.Event): Unit
----

NOTE: `postEvent` is a part of link:spark-sql-streaming-ProgressReporter.adoc#postEvent[ProgressReporter Contract].

`postEvent` simply requests the `StreamingQueryManager` to link:spark-sql-streaming-StreamingQueryManager.adoc#postListenerEvent[post] the input event (to the link:spark-sql-streaming-StreamingQueryListenerBus.adoc[StreamingQueryListenerBus] in the current `SparkSession`).

NOTE: `postEvent` uses `SparkSession` to access the current `StreamingQueryManager`.

[NOTE]
====
`postEvent` is used when:

* `ProgressReporter` link:spark-sql-streaming-ProgressReporter.adoc#updateProgress[reports update progress] (while link:spark-sql-streaming-ProgressReporter.adoc#finishTrigger[finishing a trigger])

* `StreamExecution` <<runBatches, runs streaming batches>> (and announces starting a streaming query by posting a link:spark-sql-streaming-StreamingQueryListener.adoc#QueryStartedEvent[QueryStartedEvent] and query termination by posting a link:spark-sql-streaming-StreamingQueryListener.adoc#QueryTerminatedEvent[QueryTerminatedEvent])
====

=== [[processAllAvailable]] Waiting Until No Data Available in Sources or Query Has Been Terminated -- `processAllAvailable` Method

[source, scala]
----
processAllAvailable(): Unit
----

NOTE: `processAllAvailable` is a part of link:spark-sql-streaming-StreamingQuery.adoc#processAllAvailable[StreamingQuery Contract].

`processAllAvailable` reports <<streamDeathCause, streamDeathCause>> exception if defined (and returns).

NOTE: <<streamDeathCause, streamDeathCause>> is defined exclusively when `StreamExecution` <<runBatches, runs streaming batches>> (and terminated with an exception).

`processAllAvailable` returns when <<isActive, isActive>> flag is turned off (which is when `StreamExecution` is in `TERMINATED` state).

`processAllAvailable` acquires a lock on <<awaitProgressLock, awaitProgressLock>> and turns <<noNewData, noNewData>> flag off.

`processAllAvailable` keeps waiting 10 seconds for <<awaitProgressLockCondition, awaitProgressLockCondition>> until <<noNewData, noNewData>> flag is turned on or `StreamExecution` is no longer <<isActive, active>>.

NOTE: <<noNewData, noNewData>> flag is turned on exclusively when `StreamExecution` <<constructNextBatch, constructs the next streaming batch>> (and finds that <<constructNextBatch-hasNewData-false, no data is available>>).

In the end, `processAllAvailable` releases <<awaitProgressLock, awaitProgressLock>> lock.

=== [[queryExecutionThread]] Stream Execution Thread -- `queryExecutionThread` Property

[source, scala]
----
queryExecutionThread: QueryExecutionThread
----

`queryExecutionThread` is a Java thread of execution (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Thread.html[java.util.Thread]) that <<runStream, runs the structured query>> when started.

`queryExecutionThread` uses the name *stream execution thread for [id]* (that uses <<prettyIdString, prettyIdString>> for the id, i.e. `queryName [id = [id], runId = [runId]]`).

`queryExecutionThread` is a <<spark-sql-streaming-QueryExecutionThread.adoc#, QueryExecutionThread>> (that is a Spark `UninterruptibleThread` with `runUninterruptibly` method for running a block of code without being interrupted by `Thread.interrupt()`).

`queryExecutionThread` is started (as a daemon thread) when `StreamExecution` is requested to <<start, start>>.

When started, `queryExecutionThread` sets the thread-local properties as the <<callSite, call site>> and <<runBatches, runs the streaming query>>.

[TIP]
====
Use Java's http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/management/jconsole.html[jconsole] or https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/jstack.html[jstack] to monitor the streaming threads.

```
$ jstack <driver-pid> \| grep -e "stream execution thread"
"stream execution thread for kafka-topic1 [id =...
```
