# StateManager

`StateManager` is the <<contract, abstraction>> of <<implementations, state managers>> that act as _middlemen_ between [state stores](../stateful-stream-processing/StateStore.md) and the [FlatMapGroupsWithStateExec](../physical-operators/FlatMapGroupsWithStateExec.md) physical operator used in [Arbitrary Stateful Streaming Aggregation](../arbitrary-stateful-streaming-aggregation/index.md).

| Method
| Description

| getAllState
a| [[getAllState]]

[source, scala]
----
getAllState(store: StateStore): Iterator[StateData]
----

Retrieves all state data (for all keys) from the [StateStore](../stateful-stream-processing/StateStore.md)

Used when `InputProcessor` is requested to [processTimedOutState](InputProcessor.md#processTimedOutState)

| getState
a| [[getState]]

[source, scala]
----
getState(
  store: StateStore,
  keyRow: UnsafeRow): StateData
----

Gets the state data for the key from the [StateStore](../stateful-stream-processing/StateStore.md)

Used exclusively when `InputProcessor` is requested to [processNewData](InputProcessor.md#processNewData)

| putState
a| [[putState]]

[source, scala]
----
putState(
  store: StateStore,
  keyRow: UnsafeRow,
  state: Any,
  timeoutTimestamp: Long): Unit
----

Persists (_puts_) the state value for the key in the [StateStore](../stateful-stream-processing/StateStore.md)

Used exclusively when `InputProcessor` is requested to [callFunctionAndUpdateState](InputProcessor.md#callFunctionAndUpdateState) ([right after all rows have been processed](InputProcessor.md#onIteratorCompletion))

| removeState
a| [[removeState]]

[source, scala]
----
removeState(
  store: StateStore,
  keyRow: UnsafeRow): Unit
----

Removes the state for the key from the [StateStore](../stateful-stream-processing/StateStore.md)

Used exclusively when `InputProcessor` is requested to [callFunctionAndUpdateState](InputProcessor.md#callFunctionAndUpdateState) ([right after all rows have been processed](InputProcessor.md#onIteratorCompletion))

| stateSchema
a| [[stateSchema]]

[source, scala]
----
stateSchema: StructType
----

*State schema*

!!! note
    [It looks like](../stateful-stream-processing/StateStoreOps.md#mapPartitionsWithStateStore) (in [StateManager](../physical-operators/FlatMapGroupsWithStateExec.md#stateManager) of the [FlatMapGroupsWithStateExec](../physical-operators/FlatMapGroupsWithStateExec.md) physical operator) `stateSchema` is used for the schema of state value objects (not state keys as they are described by the grouping attributes instead).

Used when:

* [FlatMapGroupsWithStateExec](../physical-operators/FlatMapGroupsWithStateExec.md) physical operator is executed

* `StateManagerImplBase` is requested for the [stateDeserializerFunc](StateManagerImplBase.md#stateDeserializerFunc)

|===

[[implementations]]
NOTE: <<StateManagerImplBase.md#, StateManagerImplBase>> is the one and only known direct implementation of the <<contract, StateManager Contract>> in Spark Structured Streaming.

NOTE: `StateManager` is a Scala *sealed trait* which means that all the <<implementations, implementations>> are in the same compilation unit (a single file).
