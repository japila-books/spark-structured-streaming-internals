== [[StreamWriteSupport]] StreamWriteSupport Contract -- DataSourceV2 Sinks with Custom StreamWriter

`StreamWriteSupport` is the <<contract, abstraction>> of <<implementations, DataSourceV2 sinks>> that can <<createStreamWriter, create a StreamWriter>> (when used in streaming queries in <<spark-sql-streaming-MicroBatchExecution.adoc#, MicroBatchExecution>> and <<spark-sql-streaming-ContinuousExecution.adoc#, ContinuousExecution>>).

[[contract]]
[[createStreamWriter]]
[source, java]
----
StreamWriter createStreamWriter(
  String queryId,
  StructType schema,
  OutputMode mode,
  DataSourceOptions options)
----

`createStreamWriter` is used when the <<spark-sql-streaming-StreamExecution.adoc#queryExecutionThread, stream execution thread for a streaming query>> is <<spark-sql-streaming-StreamExecution.adoc#start, started>> and requests the stream execution engines to start, i.e.

* `ContinuousExecution` is requested to <<spark-sql-streaming-ContinuousExecution.adoc#runContinuous, runContinuous>>

* `MicroBatchExecution` is requested to <<spark-sql-streaming-MicroBatchExecution.adoc#runBatch, run a single streaming batch>>
